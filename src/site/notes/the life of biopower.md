# *The History of Sexuality*, Part V: “Right of Death and Power Over Life,” 1976

[[Foucault\|Foucault]]'s account of the shift from sovereign power (take life or let live) to biopower (make live and let die)

---

sovereign power (135-6)
- "take life or let live"
- negative
- symbolized by the sword
- society's power is that of deduction (taxes, appropriation of labor and goods/services)

---

sovereign power undergoes a shift (136-7)
- deduction is no longer dominant
- negative → positive ("generating forces, making them grow, ordering them")
- death → the "reverse" of society's positive power
- wars are just as bloody under this positive power (death appears as serving life, wars are no longer justified by the negative right of a sovereign power, but by the sovereign's right in terms of the BIOLOGICAL EXISTENCE OF POPULATIONS ("species," "race"))
	- this thesis is supported by the decrease in # of deaths from executions (which are a direct symbol of negative power, sovereign power, the power symbolized by the sword — executions are inconsistent with positive power, the sustenance of life) and the increase in # of deaths from war (137-8)
- death becomes residual (138-9)
	- power is about LIFE, death is the limit, hence SECRET, PRIVATE, less rituals associated with death, suicide becomes less a criminal usurping of the sovereign power's right and more sociological event regarding PRIVATE rights

---

17th century power: evolved in two basic forms, two poles (139)
- (1) focused on the individual body as machine, DISCIPLINE, the ANATAMO-POLITICS of the human body
- (2) formed somewhat later, focused on biological processes of human life (birth, death, health, etc.) requiring REGULATORY controls (THIS IS BIOPOLITICS, a biopolitics of the population)

(this bipolar system defines a new form of power whose highest function is no longer to kill but to invest in life at every level, body and population)

---

sovereign power replaced by biopower (140)
- (in classical period, rise of various disciplines and new political/economic concerns regarding birth rates, migration, housing, health, etc.) (mirroring two forms ↑). THIS IS THE INAUGURATION OF THE ERA OF BIOPOWER
- IDEOLOGISTS attempted to unify these developments into abstract doctrine / system ...  but for Foucault, these two poles ↑ are not joined through speculative discourse but in concrete arrangements (sexuality the most important ↓)  
- biopower was essential for rise of capitalism (capitalism required INSERTION of bodies into production and REGULATION of populations) (141)
	- i.e., biopower enabled capitalism to link demographic growth with economic growth (?) ... and then biopower becomes important for capitalist power (economic and political)
- sovereign power replaced by biopower is the shift from man as a living animal with capacity for political existence ([[Aristotle\|Aristotle]]), to man as an an animal whose politics places his existence as a living being in question (modernity, this is the THRESHOLD OF MODERNITY) (142-3)
- ↑ "life" and "man" become central objects of inquiry (disrupting Classical episteme) BECAUSE life has a dual position now: outside history as part of biological environment, and inside history as something penetrated by knowledge-power techniques (143)

---

also
- "a normalizing society is the historical outcome of a technology of power centered on life" (144)
	- i.e., that: ALSO with rise of bio-power, dominance not of law (sovereign, backed by the threat of death, sword), but norm (life, regulation, correction, etc.)  
	- and law changes function (becomes a norm itself, subsumed into regulatory systems)  ... in this NORMALIZING SOCIETY, this is JURIDICAL REGRESSION
- by 19th century, resistance itself became bio-political (life became the terrain of power AND resistance) (145)
- "it gave rise as well to comprehensive measures, statistical assessments, and interventions aimed at the entire social body or at groups taken as a whole. Sex was a means of access both to the life of the body and the life of the species" (145-6)

---

sex (146-7)
- ↑ this is why sex is important. sex connects the two poles of bio-power (individual bodies and population, discipline and regulation, anatamo-politics, and bio-politics). this is why, in 19th century (e.g., [[Freud\|Freud]]) sex is so interesting, sought out everywhere, connecting everything ... Freud's pansexualism
- 4 "lines of attack along which the politics of sex advanced" (146-7)
	- (1) sexualization of children (threat of which justified surveillance)
	- (2) hysterization of women (justified in terms of responsibility for children's health family stability, etc.)
	- (3) birth control
	- (4) psychiatrization of perversions (regulatory in nature, but relies on individual disciplines)

---

symbolics of blood → analytics of sexuality (147-8)
- for sovereign power: a symbolics of blood (real and symbolic element ... blood as the medium of through which power expressed itself)  
- for bio-power: an analytics of sexuality (sex becomes central object, not as a symbol, but as a subject of analysis, classification, measurement, etc.)  
- blood is precarious and rare .. not the case for sex

---

(149)
- the first eugenicists represent this shift from blood → sex ("dreams of perfecting the species" .. in this case, the concept of RACE shifts away from aristocratic bloodlines toward the biological effects of sex (fertility, heredity, etc.) ...
- [[Sade\|Sade]] does a similar analysis of sex, but reinscribes sexuality in the blood symbol (sex as absolute sovereignty) ...

---

(150)
- this ↑ shows that symbolics of blood and analytics of sexuality are not distinct, non-overlapping phases ..
- blood-symbol re-enters sexuality politics with RACE as the hinge ..
- politics of sexuality in family marriage reproduction health education etc. gets legitimacy from the symbol of blood (blood purity, racial triumph)
- see Nazism (where blood symbol dominated in this sense
- ↑ psychoanalysis does the opposite by grounding sexuality in the law (old order of power) ..
- in this sense, psychoanalysis de-biologized sexuality
- i.e., the view of sexuality for fascism was primarily biological, but for Freud, symbolic
- grounded in blood for fascism and law for Freud
    

---

(151)
- Foucault preempts the objection against him that he it too historicist (reducing sex to the history of sexuality, i.e., doing a castration) (his refusal to do an ontology of sex)
- to Foucault, these critiques ↑ ignore the fact that analyzing sexuality does not equate to the erasure of biological sex (in fact, analysis of biopower is what shows that the biological and historical are intertwined)
    

---

(151-3)
- what does "sex" really mean? cause in the 19th century, sex was quasi-metaphysical (developed via hysterization of women and sexualization of childhood ... in these deployments, sex as paradoxical: present and absent, whole and part, etc., is developed) ...
- that is to say that sex was never described just in terms of genitals and reproduction ... sex was already an ESSENCE
    

---

(154-5)

- again, sex is important because it presents anatomical, biological, behavioral, sensible functions in a (fictitious) unity

> the idea of "sex" makes it possible to evade what gives "power" its power; it enables one to conceive power solely as law and taboo. Sex — that agency which appears to dominate us and that secret which seems to underlie all that we are, that point which enthralls us through the the power it manifests and the meaning it conceals, and which we ask to reveal what we are and to free us from what defines us — is doubtless but an ideal point made necessary by the deployment of sexuality and its operation. We must not make the mistake of thinking that sex is an autonomous agency which secondarily produces manifold effects of sexuality over the entire length of its surface of contact with power. On the contrary, sex is the most speculative, most ideal, and most internal element in a deployment of sexuality organized by power in its grip on bodies and their materiality, their forces, energies, sensations, and pleasures

---

(156)
- ALSO, it is through sex that each individual becomes intelligible to themselves (sex as hidden and generative, and as representing the whole self)
- "sex" (in this sense) is the product of a history, e.g., from Christian practices on, and against such an intense signification that it becomes "worth dying for" (death instinct, death drive)
    
---

(156-7

- sex is an imaginary element ...
- belief in the affirmation of sexual freedom and rights is participation in system of power (seems sacred, but is historically and socially produced)

---

(157)
- must not place sex outside of the history of sexuality ... focus should be on bodies, pleasures, knowledge .. their "multiplicity and their possibility of resistance"
    

---

(158-9)

> And what we now perceive as the chronicle of a censorship and the difficult struggle to remove it will be seen rather as the centuries-long rise of a complex deployment for compelling sex to speak, for fastening our attention and concern upon sex, for getting us to believe in the sovereignty of its law when in fact we were moved by the power mechanisms of sexuality.

- despite repression (e.g., Christian asceticism, bourgeois morality) society was actively producing sexuality (or sex?), deploying it
- (sovereignty of sex is an illusion, we are "MOVED BY THE POWER MECHANISMS OF SEXUALITY"
- SO, critics of Freud critique his pansexualism (finding sex everywhere) but Foucault says they miss the historical context ... ↑ sexuality was already in deployment











biopower has death as its limit, and therefore must confront the paradox of killing, e.g., wars, executions, etc., as part of a fostering, cultivation, and regulation of life. 
biopower as bi-polar (disciplining individual bodies and regulating populations). 
biopower was essential for the rise of capitalism and the rise of modernity (man as a living animal with the capacity for political existence (Aristotle), to man as an an animal whose politics places his existence as a living being in question), 
the subsuming of law into norms (normalizing society), 

the shift from a symbolics of blood to an analytics of sexuality. 
sex is central insofar as it links both poles of biopower, producing obsessions with childhood, women, perversions, and reproduction. Far from being repressed (*contra* Freudian picture), sex was already in deployment (*pro* Freudian “pansexualism”).
