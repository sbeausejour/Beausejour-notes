# [[Foucault\|Foucault]], *The History of Sexuality*, Part V: “Right of Death and Power Over Life,” 1976

an account of the shift from sovereign power (take life or let live) to biopower (make live and let die)

sovereign power (135-6)
- "take life or let live"
- negative
- symbolized by the sword
- society's power is that of deduction (taxes, appropriation of labor and goods/services)

sovereign power undergoes a shift (136-7)
- deduction is no longer dominant
- negative -> positive ("generating forces, making them grow, ordering them")
- death -> the "reverse" of society's positive power
- wars are just as bloody under this positive power (death appears as serving life, wars are no longer justified by the negative right of a sovereign power, but by the sovereign's right in terms of the BIOLOGICAL EXISTENCE of POPULATIONS ("species," "race"))
	- this thesis is supported by the decrease in # of deaths from executions (which are a direct symbol of negative power, sovereign power, the power symbolized by the sword — executions are inconsistent with positive power, the sustenance of life) and the increase in # of deaths from war (137-8)
- 
- (all of this ^ is given support by the fact that executions (death penalty, direct symbol of NEGATIVE power, sword) have decreased even as war deaths increased ...  


biopower has death as its limit, and therefore must confront the paradox of killing, e.g., wars, executions, etc., as part of a fostering, cultivation, and regulation of life. 
biopower as bi-polar (disciplining individual bodies and regulating populations). 
biopower was essential for the rise of capitalism and the rise of modernity (man as a living animal with the capacity for political existence (Aristotle), to man as an an animal whose politics places his existence as a living being in question), 
the subsuming of law into norms (normalizing society), 

the shift from a symbolics of blood to an analytics of sexuality. 
sex is central insofar as it links both poles of biopower, producing obsessions with childhood, women, perversions, and reproduction. Far from being repressed (*contra* Freudian picture), sex was already in deployment (*pro* Freudian “pansexualism”).
