# *The History of Sexuality*, Part V: “Right of Death and Power Over Life,” 1976

**[[Foucault\|Foucault]]'s account of the shift from sovereign power ("take life or let live") to biopower ("make live and let die"); this is a movement from a negative power symbolized by the sword and deduction to a positive power focused on generating forces, making them grow, ordering them, and investing in life. Biopower evolves in two poles: discipline focused on the individual body as machine (anatamo-politics) and regulations focused on biological processes of populations (biopolitics), thus forming a bipolar system whose highest function is no longer to kill but to invest in life. Foucault draws various consequences of this bipolar system of biopower, e.g., death becomes residual, the rise of capitalism, the rise of modernity (where man is an animal whose politics places his existence as a living being in question, against [[Aristotle\|Aristotle]]), law is subsumed into norms (normalizing society), and a "symbolics of blood" is shifted to an "analytics of sexuality." Sex is important insofar as it is a means of access to anatamo-politics and biopolitics, to disciplines and regulations; from this, the politics of sex advanced through "four great lines of attack": the sexualization of children, the hysterization of women, birth control, and the psychiatrization of perversions; so, far from being repressed (against [[Freud\|Freud]]), sex was already in deployment (against critics of Freudian pansexualism).**

---

sovereign power (135-6)
- "take life or let live"
- negative
- symbolized by the sword
- society's power is that of deduction (taxes, appropriation of labor and goods/services)

---

sovereign power undergoes a shift (136-7)
- deduction is no longer dominant
- negative → positive ("generating forces, making them grow, ordering them")
- death → the "reverse" of society's positive power
- wars are just as bloody under this positive power (death appears as serving life, wars are no longer justified by the negative right of a sovereign power, but by the sovereign's right in terms of the BIOLOGICAL EXISTENCE OF POPULATIONS ("species," "race"))
	- this thesis is supported by the decrease in # of deaths from executions (which are a direct symbol of negative power, sovereign power, the power symbolized by the sword — executions are inconsistent with positive power, the sustenance of life) and the increase in # of deaths from war (137-8)
- death becomes residual (138-9)
	- power is about LIFE, death is the limit, hence SECRET, PRIVATE, less rituals associated with death, suicide becomes less a criminal usurping of the sovereign power's right and more sociological event regarding PRIVATE rights

---

17th century power: evolved in two basic forms, two poles (139)
- (1) focused on the individual body as machine, DISCIPLINE, the ANATAMO-POLITICS of the human body
- (2) formed somewhat later, focused on biological processes of human life (birth, death, health, etc.) requiring REGULATORY controls (THIS IS BIOPOLITICS, a biopolitics of the population)

(this bipolar system defines a new form of power whose highest function is no longer to kill but to invest in life at every level, body and population)

---

sovereign power replaced by biopower (140)
- (in classical period, rise of various disciplines and new political/economic concerns regarding birth rates, migration, housing, health, etc.) (mirroring two forms ↑). THIS IS THE INAUGURATION OF THE ERA OF BIOPOWER
- IDEOLOGISTS attempted to unify these developments into abstract doctrine / system ...  but for Foucault, these two poles ↑ are not joined through speculative discourse but in concrete arrangements (sexuality the most important ↓)  
- biopower was essential for rise of capitalism (capitalism required INSERTION of bodies into production and REGULATION of populations) (141)
	- i.e., biopower enabled capitalism to link demographic growth with economic growth (?) ... and then biopower becomes important for capitalist power (economic and political)
- sovereign power replaced by biopower is the shift from man as a living animal with capacity for political existence ([[Aristotle\|Aristotle]]), to man as an an animal whose politics places his existence as a living being in question (modernity, this is the THRESHOLD OF MODERNITY) (142-3)
- ↑ "life" and "man" become central objects of inquiry (disrupting Classical episteme) BECAUSE life has a dual position now: outside history as part of biological environment, and inside history as something penetrated by knowledge-power techniques (143)

---

also
- "a normalizing society is the historical outcome of a technology of power centered on life" (144)
	- i.e., that: ALSO with rise of bio-power, dominance not of law (sovereign, backed by the threat of death, sword), but norm (life, regulation, correction, etc.)  
	- and law changes function (becomes a norm itself, subsumed into regulatory systems)  ... in this NORMALIZING SOCIETY, this is JURIDICAL REGRESSION
- by 19th century, resistance itself became bio-political (life became the terrain of power AND resistance) (145)
- "it gave rise as well to comprehensive measures, statistical assessments, and interventions aimed at the entire social body or at groups taken as a whole. Sex was a means of access both to the life of the body and the life of the species" (145-6)

---

sex (146-7)
- ↑ this is why sex is important. sex connects the two poles of bio-power (individual bodies and population, discipline and regulation, anatamo-politics, and bio-politics). this is why, in 19th century (e.g., [[Freud\|Freud]]) sex is so interesting, sought out everywhere, connecting everything ... Freud's pansexualism
- 4 "lines of attack along which the politics of sex advanced" (146-7)
	- (1) sexualization of children (threat of which justified surveillance)
	- (2) hysterization of women (justified in terms of responsibility for children's health family stability, etc.)
	- (3) birth control
	- (4) psychiatrization of perversions (regulatory in nature, but relies on individual disciplines)

---

symbolics of blood → analytics of sexuality (147-8)
- for sovereign power: a symbolics of blood (real and symbolic element ... blood as the medium of through which power expressed itself)  
- for bio-power: an analytics of sexuality (sex becomes central object, not as a symbol, but as a subject of analysis, classification, measurement, etc.)  
- blood is precarious and rare .. not the case for sex

---

(149)
- the first eugenicists represent this shift from blood → sex ("dreams of perfecting the species" .. in this case, the concept of RACE shifts away from aristocratic bloodlines toward the biological effects of sex (fertility, heredity, etc.) ...
- [[Sade\|Sade]] does a similar analysis of sex, but reinscribes sexuality in the blood symbol (sex as absolute sovereignty) ...

---

(150)
- this ↑ shows that symbolics of blood and analytics of sexuality are not distinct, non-overlapping phases ..
- blood-symbol re-enters sexuality politics with RACE as the hinge ..
- politics of sexuality in family marriage reproduction health education etc. gets legitimacy from the symbol of blood (blood purity, racial triumph)
- see Nazism (where blood symbol dominated in this sense
- ↑ psychoanalysis does the opposite by grounding sexuality in the law (old order of power) ..
- in this sense, psychoanalysis de-biologized sexuality
- i.e., the view of sexuality for fascism was primarily biological, but for Freud, symbolic
- grounded in blood for fascism and law for Freud
    
---

(151)
- Foucault preempts the objection against him that he it too historicist (reducing sex to the history of sexuality, i.e., doing a castration) (his refusal to do an ontology of sex)
- to Foucault, these critiques ↑ ignore the fact that analyzing sexuality does not equate to the erasure of biological sex (in fact, analysis of biopower is what shows that the biological and historical are intertwined)
    
---

(151-3)
- what does "sex" really mean? cause in the 19th century, sex was quasi-metaphysical (developed via hysterization of women and sexualization of childhood ... in these deployments, sex as paradoxical: present and absent, whole and part, etc., is developed) ...
- that is to say that sex was never described just in terms of genitals and reproduction ... sex was already an ESSENCE
    
---

(154-5)

- again, sex is important because it presents anatomical, biological, behavioral, sensible functions in a (fictitious) unity

> the idea of "sex" makes it possible to evade what gives "power" its power; it enables one to conceive power solely as law and taboo. Sex — that agency which appears to dominate us and that secret which seems to underlie all that we are, that point which enthralls us through the the power it manifests and the meaning it conceals, and which we ask to reveal what we are and to free us from what defines us — is doubtless but an ideal point made necessary by the deployment of sexuality and its operation. We must not make the mistake of thinking that sex is an autonomous agency which secondarily produces manifold effects of sexuality over the entire length of its surface of contact with power. On the contrary, sex is the most speculative, most ideal, and most internal element in a deployment of sexuality organized by power in its grip on bodies and their materiality, their forces, energies, sensations, and pleasures

---

(156)
- ALSO, it is through sex that each individual becomes intelligible to themselves (sex as hidden and generative, and as representing the whole self)
- "sex" (in this sense) is the product of a history, e.g., from Christian practices on, and against such an intense signification that it becomes "worth dying for" (death instinct, death drive)
    
---

(156-7)
- sex is an imaginary element ...
- belief in the affirmation of sexual freedom and rights is participation in system of power (seems sacred, but is historically and socially produced)

---

(157)
- must not place sex outside of the history of sexuality ... focus should be on bodies, pleasures, knowledge .. their "multiplicity and their possibility of resistance"
    
---

(158-9)

> And what we now perceive as the chronicle of a censorship and the difficult struggle to remove it will be seen rather as the centuries-long rise of a complex deployment for compelling sex to speak, for fastening our attention and concern upon sex, for getting us to believe in the sovereignty of its law when in fact we were moved by the power mechanisms of sexuality.

- despite repression (e.g., Christian asceticism, bourgeois morality) society was actively producing sexuality (or sex?), deploying it
- (sovereignty of sex is an illusion, we are "MOVED BY THE POWER MECHANISMS OF SEXUALITY"
- SO, critics of Freud critique his pansexualism (finding sex everywhere) but Foucault says they miss the historical context ... ↑ sexuality was already in deployment
# "Society Must Be Defended," eleven, 1976

**[[Foucault\|Foucault]]'s earlier account of the shift from sovereign power to biopower. Rather than centralizing sex, Foucault centralizes State racism. Rather than just describing race as re-entering into sexual and political discourse via, e.g., eugenics and fertility, Foucault says: race is the mechanism by which biopower's positive function of "making live" can authorize "letting die." Racism provides this function by fracturing the biological continuum of the population, introducing divisions and groups, shifting the traditional focus on sovereign enemies to biological enemies (e.g., inferior races, degenerates, etc., which may be intra-population). This logic is located, clearly, in Nazism, but Foucault says it is present in all modern states; simply, once a state has accepted the mechanisms of biopower, the only way to reconcile “making live” with the necessity of killing is through racism.**

---

(239)
- war as grid for understanding historical process
- in 18th century, war as race conflicts ...
- war gets displaced, but race persists in STATE RACISM
- my note: keep in mind the focus on race as opposed to on sex in *the history of sexuality* ↑

---

(240-1)
- 19th century. the biological comes under the control of State power
- again, sovereign power (to take life or let live) is complemented by a new opposite right (make live and let die)

---

(241-2)
- this idea of life was already problematized in jurists' debates in 17th-18th century ...
	- i.e., if social contract delegates power to the sovereign to preserve lives (due to some external threat), how could life be the sovereigns right? putting it that way, it seems that "life" already assumed, it is already foundational
- Foucault puts this aside, he is more concerned with the atomics of power, e.g., DISCIPLINE (which makes life the object of management)
	- my note: Foucault as a power atomist, against [[Althusser\|Althusser]]

---

(242-3)
- Foucault, in *the history of sexuality*, describes anatamo-politics and biopolitics. here, he describes in more detail their sequential development
- first, man as body, then, man as living being, living species
- anatamo-politics (individualizing) v. biopolitics (massifying)

---

(243-4)
- 2nd half of 18th century, development of demography (targets like ratio of births to deaths, fertility, morality rate, etc.) ...
- biopolitics as statistical
- natalist policies show that biopolitics is not just descriptive, also prescriptive ... 
- also instead of a concern with epidemics (death swoops down suddenly), a concern with endemics (death becomes permanent, gnawing, immanent within life itself .. within population)
- biopolitics extends beyond just mortality and fertility to a whole range of incapacities / accidents ..  these become embedded not just in charities, but in rational frameworks, e.g., insurance ...

---

(245-6)
- the phenomena studied in biopolitics (not anatamo-politics) are only pertinent at mass level (unpredictable when taken individual), must be studied over time ...

> “Disciplines, for their part, dealt with individuals and their bodies in practical terms. What we are dealing with in this new technology of power is not exactly society (or at 'least not the social body, as defined by the jurists), nor is it the individual- as-body. It is a new body, a multiple body, a body with so many heads that, while they might not be infinite in number, cannot necessarily be counted. Biopolitics deals with the population, with the population as political problem, as a problem that is at once scientific and political, as a biological problem and as power's problem. And I think that biopolitics emerges at this time” 

---

(246-8)
- insofar as bio-politics is concerned with certain mechanisms (forecasts, statistical mechanisms), their purpose is not to modify an individual, but to intervene at the level of these general phenomena ...  thus a shift from discipline to regulation (regularized society)
- biopower as make live and let die ...  
- make live = productive
- let die = the de-ritualization of death (this moment was ritualized under sovereign power because it was the transfer from sovereign power to divine power, from living to divine, etc.) ...  
- since biopower focuses on "making live," death becomes something outside of this positive field of action ....
	- i.e., insofar as biopower is concerned with cultivating LIFE, its power ENDS with death (so it is natural that is becomes privatized) ...
	- what was once the most grand manifestation of power (death), power now ignores ... power ignores death

---

(249-50)

> One might say this: It is as though power, which used to have sovereignty as its modality or organizing schema, found itself unable to govern the economic and political body of a society that was undergoing both a demographic explosion and industrialization. So much so that far too many things were escaping the old mechanism of the power of sovereignty, both at the top and at the bottom, both at the level of detail and at the mass level. A first adjustment was made to take care of the details. Discipline had meant adjusting power mechanisms to the individual body by using surveillance and training. That, of course, was the easier and more convenient thing to adjust. That is why it was the first to be introduced—as early as the seventeenth century, or the beginning of the eighteenth—at a local level, in intuitive, empirical, and fragmented forms, and in the restricted framework of institutions such as schools, hospitals, barracks, workshops, and so on. And then at the end of the eighteenth century, you have a second adjustment; the mechanisms are adjusted to phenomena of population, to the biological or biosociological processes characteristic of human masses. This adjustment was obviously much more difficult to make because it implied complex systems of coordination and centralization.

---

(250-2)
- there is not just body-organism-discipline institutions and the population-biological processes-regulatory mechanisms. State apparatuses as completely separate entities ... disciplines take on Statist dimension and vise versa
- e.g., consider working class housing estates (towns) in 19th century ...  
	- both technologies of power converge (disciplinary (individuals are made visible, anticipating panopticism?) and regulatory (rules on hygiene, health insurance, pressures that the town imposes on sex, child care, education, etc.)

---

(252)
- sexuality as important as a meeting of body and population. ofc, taken up in *the history of sexuality*
- medicine in the same way (e.g., controlling behavior and life expectancy, fertility, etc.) ...

---

(252-3)
- the NORM links the disciplinary body and regulatory population ...  so, NORMALIZING SOCIETY

---

(253-4)
- excess of sovereignty → death overrides life, symbolized by atomic bomb
- excess of biopower → technological (and political) possibility to proliferate life in a sense that it cannot be controlled

---

(254-7)
- **in *the history of sexuality*, Foucault describes race as re-entering into sexual and political discourse (blood, eugenics, fertility)**
- **here, there is a clearer function: race is the mechanism by which biopower's positive function (making live) can authorize letting die (racism provides the political and scientific basis for the state to distribute death)**
- ↓ where biopower treats population as biological continuum, racism fractures that continuum ... caesura ... introduces divisions within life (fragments groups) ...

> Once the State functions in the biopower mode, racism alone can justify the murderous function of the State. 

- old logic of war said that if you want to live you must destroy enemies .. 
	- racism transposes this biologically by changing focus from sovereign enemies to biological enemies (inferior races, degenerates, etc. ..... INTRA POPULATION)
	- IN THIS SENSE, racism doesn't just justify killing, it transforms it into a normalizing function
- this ↑ logic dovetails with evolutionism ...  
	- Foucault distinguishes between [[Darwin\|Darwin]]ism and the uses of Darwinism (this is the scientific framework for state racism)
- RACISM LETS A STATE (UNDER BIOPOWER) KILL FOR THE SAKE OF LIFE

---

(257-63)
- Nazism was where biopower and sovereign power collapsed into each other ... Nazism as disciplinary and also biological .. but also sovereign right to kill
- the logic of this is present in all modern states (and socialism is not immune, since socialism has never done a complete critique of biopower)  
	- i.e., racism as the precondition for state-distributed death
	- **i.e., socialism also accepted the mechanisms of biopower ... and once these mechanisms are in place, the only way to reconcile “making live” with the necessity of killing is through racism**
# "Postscript on the Societies of Control"

**[[Deleuze\|Deleuze]] argues that the disciplinary societies described by [[Foucault\|Foucault]] (organized around enclosed institutions such as schools, factories, and prisons) entered into crisis after World War II and are being replaced by societies of control. Disciplinary societies operate via discrete enclosures that *mold* individuals and organize them into masses; control societies operate via *modulation*: flexible, networked mechanisms that track and adjust behavior in real time, fragmenting individuals into “dividuals” coded by passwords and data flows. This replacement is a mutation in law and capitalism, from a system of concentrated production and enclosure to a dispersive regime oriented toward circulation, services, finance, and marketing, in which the factory gives way to the corporation and power no longer confines bodies but continuously manages flows.**

---

(1) historical 
- when Foucault locates disciplinary societies, they all have a preeminent instance of the enclosed environment ...
	- Foucault has analyzed these enclosed spaces ... but he also recognized this models transience, succeeding that of societies of sovereign power ...
	- but this disciplinary society ceased around ww2
- Deleuze says he is writing at a time of crisis in all of these environments of enclosure ... these environments (institutions) are established, its only a matter of keeping people in these institutions until new forces come, i.e., SOCIETIES OF CONTROL, already in the process of replacing societies of discipline)
- societies of control are more flexible, no longer rigid walls, but continuous

---

(2) logic
- in disciplinary societies, each different space of enclosure is separate, but there is an analogical commonality between them ...   IN CONTROL SOCIETIES, different control mechanisms are inseparable variations, forming a NUMERICAL system ..  
- **enclosures are MOLDS, but controls are a MODULATION**  
	- factory = mold, disciplinary society (solid enclosure of a body, fixed wages, workers organized as a mass) ..... corporation = modulation (intangible, salaries constantly modulating, individuals pitted against each other, union less)
	- ALSO, perpetual training replaces school in the latter, continuous, no end point .. always starting something vs. never finishing anything

---

- [[Kafka\|Kafka]] stands at the pivot between disciplinary and control societies (*the trial*)
	- where disciplinary juridical form = “apparent acquittal” (always under threat of being called back into the enclosure), control juridical form = “limitless postponement” (never fully judged trial always on going)
	- for Deleuze, crisis of the legal time was that law was stuck between the two

---

- disciplinary societies relied on signature and number (which both individualized and formed these individuals into masses) (for Foucault this has to do with pastoral power of priest, care for flock and each sheep)
- instead ↑ of signature and number, control societies rely on a code (password)
- so, control societies rely not on this mass-individual pair, but individuals have become DIVIDUALS (codes, passwords, continuous data flows ... )

---

- types of machines and societies match. machines don't determine societies, but they express and are used by the forms of power that arise ...  
	- society of sovereignty = simple mechanical devices  
	- society of discipline = energetic machines (so expressed in enclosure)
	- society of control = computers (so expressed in networks, continuous tracking)
- these shifts ↑ are a "mutation of capitalism" ...
	- so, capitalism in 19th century is a capitalism of concentration (production centralized in factory, property concentrated by capitalist, enclosure ; this logic extends outward, the capitalist as “owner” of other enclosed spaces like the home ...
	- contemporary capitalism =  dispersive, control ... shift from production (raw materials -> products) to something else, higher order production (buying finished products, services, stocks, selling, marketing)
		- dispersive; factory gives way to corporation
	- enclosures (factory, school, family) -> networks, codes, continuous control, etc. ...
	- capitalism is thus the engine of the shift from disciplinary society → control society

---

- capitalism is thus the engine of the shift from disciplinary society → control society

> "we are taught that corporations have a soul, which is the most terrifying news in the world"

- art in discipline soc. = enclosed (museum, academy)
- art in control soc. = bank speculation determined value
- so, marketing replaces production as the soul of the corp.

---

(3) program
- again, power no longer works by enclosing, but by continuously tracking and modulating in data systems (individuals → dividuals)
# *Posthumous Life*
[[Claire Colebrook\|Claire Colebrook]] and [[Jami Weinstein\|Jami Weinstein]]
## preface

**Weinstein-Colebrook argue for a shift to posthumanism as the critical confrontation with the literal possibility of a world after humans — a critical study of life. They argue that traditional posthumanisms (transhumanist enhancement, cybernetic coupling, deconstructive destabilization, becoming-life) maintain a residual humanism: whatever has passed as humanism was always some form of posthumanism and modes of posthuman that are not sublations of humanism, but instead ultrahumanisms insofar as they insist that humans have no essence. Not only do these posthumanisms include a residual humanism, insofar as they arrive in the age of the simultaneous Anthropocene and technological maturity they also include the inhuman; going forward, it is not enough to think of these matters as questions, they must be problems. But they remain questions insofar as they have maintained a part in contemporary narrative, reaffirming the traditional human by merely generating questions of the inhuman that do not problematize the human as such.

---

(x)
- shift toward thinking at geological time scale ...  
	- in this sense, post-humanism is certainly beyond human exceptionalism or species distinctions, but we still can identify human environmental impact  
	- (possibility of HUMAN HISTORY AFTER HUMANS)
- ↑ a call for a CRITICAL STUDY OF LIFE ...
	- considering the possibility of nonexistence and limits (in this sense, aligning with [[Kant\|Kant]]ian sense of critique)  
- ↑ from this pov, must revisit posthumanism (consider the actual sense in which there will be a time POST humans ... this has been left unconsidered in trad. posthumanism)

---

(x-xi)
- ↑ exemplified by [[Deleuze\|Deleuze]]'s "superman" ...
	- not a superior / exceptional "man" but an expansion beyond the living force of "man" (compound of human forces and external, new forces)
- ↑ this, which was once imagined as freeing, is now imagined more like a contraction of life to mere survival
	- Deleuze's superman envisions human fusion with external ; this is at odds with the "no exit" warnings of scientists .. this fusion can't happen
	- at once concerned with inorganic life (life beyond life) ; but now we are presented with the problem of NO LIFE AT ALL
- ↑ the shift in all this is from posthumanism as a vision of human evolution to human ceasing to exist but still as having altered the planet ...

---

(xi)
- "it has always been the nature of 'man' to be posthuman"
	- human life conceived of in its surpassing, imagined in that which surpasses the human ... (indigenous cultures, [[Derrida\|Derrida]], [[Marx\|Marx]])
		- for Marx, man as transforming the world and surpassing limits  
- today, this conception collapses in the face of a future without humans  
- we ask the questions therefore: not how will we survive, but how our non-survival will be inscribed. what questions should we ask?

> “What questions should the last humans have posed, and would these questions be posthuman?”

---

various post-humanisms (xiii-xiv)
- [[Bostrom\|Bostrom]]'s posthumanism: as transhumanism, i.e., as HUMAN ENHANCEMENT, as a moral imperative (response to existential risks, ai, global threats, etc.)
- [[Hayles\|Hayles]] posthumanism: recognition of the things we used to take as definitively human as being dispersed ... so, she calls for a return to the HYPERATTENTION that dominated the pre-humanist past (not deep attention of close reading, philosophy, art, etc.)

> “[[Wolfe\|Wolfe]] deploys the posthuman as a method for destabilizing the human species’ claims for distinction. Rather than assuming that poststructuralism sweeps away human exceptionalism or that “we” are somehow locked within a prison house of human language, Wolfe draws from deconstruction in order to question how we think about what the human is and its supposed superhuman or posthuman mode. If we cease to define language as a privileged domain of meaning but instead regard all life as composed of differential systems, then we can neither collapse the human back into some self-present prelinguistic life nor abandon ethical concerns regarding nonhumans”

- Wolfe criticizes "humanist posthumanism" for simply granting rights or attention to animals while keeping the category of the human coherent and distinct
- [[Eduardo Viveiros de Castro\|Eduardo Viveiros de Castro]]: cannibal metaphysics
	- the desire for the posthuman has intensified a human-nonhuman binary that ought to be MULTIPLIED, not into a difference or no difference at all, but a proliferation of indifference

---

claims about the residual humanism in posthumanism (xvii)  
- (1) whatever has passed as humanism was always some form of posthumanism  
	- the human has always been defined as that which exceeds itself (as having no essence in [[Agamben\|Agamben]], being radically open in post-structuralism broadly ([[Derrida\|Derrida]] stemming from [[Heidegger\|Heidegger]]), transcending mere animality in [[Plato\|Plato]]
	- or in contemporary anti-Cartesian where the human closeness to nature reasserts human distinctiveness at the moment when natures destruction is evident
- (2) modes of posthuman that are not sublations of humanism, but instead ultrahumanisms
	- they exemplify the self fabrication of humanism the most by insisting that humans have no essence, i.e., are nothing more than self-creating potentiality

> “The supposedly radical mode of this posthumanism that defines itself against essentialism—where humans are self-negating rather than self-fabricating, insofar as they are nothing other than the encounters or “becomings” they experience—is also a dynamic intensification of the human as set apart from a world of beings. There is a form of anti-Cartesianism that is hyper-Cartesian: We would reject man as thinking substance—man as a special being—in the name of man as nothing at all, as not a thing, as pure performance, event, or act. If Descartes defined thinking substance against extended substance, then the claim that humans are not substance but pure becoming is an ultra-Cartesianism and hyperhumanism. It is, moreover, a shrill and frenzied proclamation of man’s capacity for being radically futural precisely at that point in his history where the human species seems to be threatened with its actual nonbeing.”

- (3) all this ↑ talks about what often passes for posthumanism (Bostrom’s enhancement, Hayles’ coupling, Wolfe’s destabilization, Deleuze/Butler’s becoming, Agamben’s openness, etc.) insofar as they still operate within the residual humanist/posthumanist structure ... 
	- BUT THEY ALSO ALL OCCLUDE THE LITERAL POSTHUMAN, THE LITERAL TIME AFTER HUMANS

---

(xviii)
- i.e., the mindset of radical openness / becoming fuels consumption, production, acceleration that is leading us to the literal posthuman ..  
- consider [[Meillasoux\|Meillasoux]] two types of futurity (absolute possibilities and virtual futures) to say that: focusing on man’s logical futurity (he can always be other than he is) occludes the real multiplicity of possible futures (extinction, non-carbon life, different human trajectories)  
- so, the real posthuman isn't man imagining his extension, it is thinking about the category of the human that has always meant (western) that which is associated with the trajectory of the hyperconsumer, hyperproducer, globalist, etc. ...  
- Weinstein-Colebrook's posthumanism is reopening space for other histories

---

(xix)
- posthumanism not as polysemic. its multiple meanings are symptomatic of the very problem of the human  
- i.e., the human as already posthuman (refusing to see humanity as just another biological species)
- so its interesting that just as human become undeniable as bio-geological species via, DAMAGING IMPACT on climate, discourse on posthuman RISES ... why?
	- because, the 4 projects above (Bostrom, Hayles, Wolfe, literal posthumanism) arrive in the age of the simultaneous Anthropocene AND of the singularity of tech maturity (?) ..  
	- so, all framed by the INHUMAN (its already been noted that they're framed by the human. that is, the residual humanism in posthumanism ↑). but also the inhuman. that is, this humanism / posthumanism is only only possible because of something outside of the terrain of human history altogether (inhuman)

---

the problem of the posthuman is a series of conundrums (xx)
- (1) posthumanism as a deconstruction of human exceptionalism (Derrida, Wolfe) runs into issues considering the distinctly human impact on earth (Anthropocene)
- (2) posthumanism as historical event, tech pushing humans beyond themselves ... was there was a time before this? when there was species-bound humans? or no? (most relevant to Hayles, *how we became posthuman*)
- (3) while the literal post human comes into question, there is also spec. real. claiming to provide a non-correlationist epistemic account ... so there becomes a question regarding the simultaneous deflation of the human and inflation of epistemic capacities

---

"questions" and "problems" ↑ (xxi-iii)
- how can we redistribute forces to generate new questions / concepts adequate to this disturbance? its not enough to just repeat questions, the PROBLEM is to rethink the terrain for these questions (problem in Deleuzo-Guattarian sense)
- posthuman and nonhuman remain questions and not problems insofar as they have maintained as part of current forms/genres of contemporary narrative
	- e.g., "the war between the properly human and the accidentally inhuman (zombies, invaders, terrorists, clones) allows the small redeemed essence of humanity to emerge"  
- so humanity as inhuman is admitted then circumvented narratively by splitting humanity into PROPER and ROGUE (reaffirming the human in the process)
- [[Foucault\|Foucault]] and the "death of man," and frankenstein does the same: cautionary tale that opposes hyperhumanism) ... this signals a shift to the posthumous (disturbance) from the posthuman (death of man) ... a disturbance that refuses refuses to grant humanity a redemptive role ...

---

↑ (xxiv)
- Derrida and Irigaray share the position that "man" as a subject is historically defined (so transhumanism and posthumanism are ultrahumanisms) ...
- post-structuralism (generalized) is the very problematizing of the posthuman (insofar as it shows the human as both necessary (we cant avoid our finitude) and impossible (always falls back into myth)
- so, in this sense ↑ posthumanism ought not be proclamation of the death of man into ecological harmony, crisis over loss of human excellency, demystification of  man, technoscience, etc.  
  - INSTEAD, it should be thought of as a PROBLEM, not a solution ... series of intersecting impasses ... e.g., we can note affinities with non-human life, we can note human geological transformation too

---

(xxvi-ii)
- proper names of posthumanism (Nietzsche, Heidegger, Deleuze, Derrida, etc.) and historical events (9/11, Anthropocene itself, global financial crisis) are JANUS FACED, BIVALENT regarding destruction of human and re-inscription and sanctification of it

> “We argue that we should harness the current state of disturbance of the human in the service of framing new problems. With increased fervor, we must put an end to the attempts to respond to the questions of the posthuman and supplant them with the goal of reconfiguring the forces and intensities from which they originated—because these questions require nothing less than the formation of novel problems, not answers. And it is to that purpose that this volume is directed.”

- even if human has grown unmanageable theoretically, it still persists with practical and aesthetic urgency ...
- not technoscientific urgency, cause this merely presupposes a unified we (this ignores the disturbance)
- humanities must not ANSWER the questions associated with this disturbance (human / posthuman) .... the task is to reconfigure the forces and intensities, invent new problems, etc. ...
## introduction

**This task ↑ is formalized as "critical life studies," a Kantian mode of critique that refuses to treat the "human" as privileged grounds of inquiry, even while acknowledging life as an unavoidable political imperative.**

---

(1-2)
- Weinstein-Colebrook use Nietzsche "day after tomorrow" to say that true understanding comes from living posthumously, asking off limits questions by those who dictate the scripts of what cannot be said and asked

> “Critical life studies begins with the force of a problem: One cannot simply dismiss the problem of life, precisely because life presents the most immediate of political imperatives, given the major threats to life in all its organic forms that mark the twenty-first century. Yet the concept of “life” has been used to humanize, racialize, gender, pathologize, and manage human and nonhuman bodies.”

> “Life cannot be abandoned. Any attention to language, concepts, history, culture, or other forms of mediation, far from leaving life out of play, requires a thoroughgoing interrogation of “life” that places it in relation to the various knowledge and social practices through which life is thought and formed.”

- CRITICAL LIFE STUDIES and [[Kant\|Kant]]ian sense of critique ... “we invoke the term “critical,” thus, as a specific orientation toward questioning, rendering problematic, and examining conditions and assumptions" ...
	- see also, Hamawaki's "Cavell, Skepticism, and the Idea of Philosophical Criticism"
- “the very concept of critique in its Kantian sense implies a necessary distance from life (Latour 2004)”

---

(3-4)
- life is often used as uncritical basis (political imperatives, vital norms) ... Aristotle onward life is a range of capacities
- life's knowability contested .. Foucault says it arose in 18th century ...
- and human identity often coded contra animality ... or more mildly now, animality is still coded as inhuman ...
- so we now say we can become posthuman, or become superhuman, life beyond organisms (issues shown in preface ↑) ...

> “We aim to sustain a notion of critical problems while not granting any force (such as life or the human) the privilege of being the source of critical distance.”

- critical studies does not take sides for or against life ...
	- it diagnoses shared limitations (inability to tackle the problem of life alone)
- new theoretical turns (speculative realism real, affective turn, feminist, trans, queer, critical race theory, etc.) share concerns regarding the shifting status of the human .. inclusion and exclusion, etc.

---

(5)
- life frames new problems ... it is not just another object ... between vitalism (life as absolute/generative) and critique (life’s uses/abuses), the volume positions life at the hinge of realism and mediation ...
- it explores the LABYRINTH OF LIFE, POSING FORBIDDEN QUESTIONS
- this is a tension LOST in traditional posthumanism

---

(6-7)
- the INHUMAN frames where the FIGURE OF THE human and posthuman (animals bacteria plants virtual tech) emerge
- inhuman as departure from posthuman (insofar as post reuptakes the human)
- “the posthuman should be the last question of our time — as if the inhuman rites we are performing in this volume were precisely the last rites of the posthuman”
- but its the idea of POSTHUMOUS LIFE that responds to lingering humanist assumptions
- posthumous signals deeper transformation than death of man or death of life
- multivalence of POSTHUMOUS (1) humus, after the earth, after earthly notions of home, (2) life after death, afterlife, troubling life/death categories (3) after the death of father / author, poststructuralist legacy ...
- SO THEREFORE move toward posthumous is important to account for ... contemporary global crises

> “The crisis here cuts far deeper than even a revolutionary paradigm shift could capture, as it eviscerates the world as such of its observability. This volume and critical life studies in general is consequently not a reflection about how we know a world but rather about how worlds — or different modes of time and life — generate knowing and not knowing”

---

(13)
- critical life studies is a re-inscription of the impossibility of thinking outside the habit of the human ... but nevertheless the importance of theorizing on inhuman impossibilities
- in being "critical": critical studies of life eschews sanitization ... safety of the familiar 
# Of Ecology, Immunity, and Islands

**[[Wolfe\|Wolfe]] argues that animals are not other beings with whom we share a common world by drawing upon Jacques [[Derrida\|Derrida]]’s figure of the island and [[Uexküll\|Uexküll]]'s umwelt. Instead, there is a radical disjunction among worlds, and there is no animal *in general* whose common life unites us in a happy *oikos*. Wolfe (1) subverts Esposito's affirmative biopolitics, (2) critiques the idea that "everything is connected," and (3) connects these moves to Derrida on sovereignty.**

---

(Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 138) in one sense, Big Bend is  isolated .. one of the darkest least visited U.S. places ..  
but Grebowicz shows it is also not isolated .. contested border, political, etc.

“Like Grebowicz, I want to explore these two registers together—the ecological and the political—and how the conceptual apparatus of the island functions at their point of articulation” (Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 138)

(Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 138) verticality of islands (?) ... sky islands ,,, seperate (not ridge and valley situation .. but something entirely different .. "as if they were members of a fleet without precedent)  
  
microclimate of moisture  
  
(animals stay home valleys uncrossed)  
so animals distinct, isolated faunas

“but a much more profound absence that challenges the commonplace notion in ecological thought that “everything is connected,” an absence that challenges, that is, the notion of “world,” in which islands would just be nodes, points of interconnection in a larger, encompassing fabric of life.” (Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 139) this is jagged ontology

(Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 140) Heidegger's question: “what do beasts and men have in common?” ...  
Derrida responds, works thoguh 3 theses  
  
(1) animals sand humans inhabit the same world but experience it differently  
(2) they do not share a world (human world v. world of animals)  
(3) no two BEINGS inhabit he same world at all ... the  
"UNITY OF THE WORLD is always deconstructible"  
... “there is no world, there are only islands” .. and

(Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 141) ^ (1) dominates ecological thought ..  
but Wolfe says (3) is most radical .. this is what he positions toward. ..  
for Derrida this is not just about human and naimal ... insofar as we can never becertain what forms of life fall under this description

(Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 141) Derrida’s “no world, only islands” sounds paradoxical until read through biology ...  
 in ssytems theory there is literally no shared world ...  
Uexkull says each organism lives in its own umwelt  
  
Maturana and Varela clarify: what counts as world is always a particcular autopoiesis .. i.e., that living ystem is organizationally closed but structurally open ...  
like Derrida's island

“There is no “world,” in other words, not just because what counts as “world” depends upon any particular life form’s autopoietic self-reference, its own internal mode of organization, but also because the system/environment relationship is above all a phenomenon of temporalized complexity” (Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 141)

(Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 142) ^ temporality important here because of the vast non-ergocity .. "when the possibilities are vastly larger than what can actually happen, history enters." KAUFFMAN

(Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 143) Kauffman extends this ^ to Kantian wholes (organisms?) ... so the lost maples are a Derridean trace .. haunts us with past and future that demonstrates the lack of a "world" (?)  
  
...  
  
so Wolfe: denying a philosophical realism (transparent representation of the world?) is NOT equal to denying material reality itself ... confusion of materialism (the world exists) with realism (we can know it as it is) is distortionary ..  
BOTH realism and materlialsm rely on representationalism (truth as a match between words and things ...  
so for Wolfe, ecological / philosophical understanding must move beyond representaionaism (see Rorty) .. toward seeing worlds / organisms etc as ISLANDS OF a sort of relation .. not transparent mirrors ? . (?)  
..  
MORE ON REPRESENTATIONALISM, see Baz' epilogue of When words are called for .

(Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 145) now Wolfe turns from epistemolgocal to ethico-political stakes ...  
humans must constantly make decisions drawing out, from derrida, the inseperatability (?) of killing and letting die ..  
politicall charged LETTING DIE in the case of the maple trees ...  
Grebowicz critiques national parks on these grounds insofar as they are used to naturalize democracy ..  
Esposito .. immunity and community ... immunity is meant to protect life, but pushed too far it negatives it (isolates it sterilizes etc. ..) community quires an encounter with existence outside itself ..

(Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 146) so for esposito, community is not external but internal (inherent?) ... defied through impossibiilty AND necessity .. we share the LACK of community ... non-belnging  
so if COMMUNITY is simply the FORMAL SEMIOTIC RELATION OF DIFFERENCE OF THE "WITH" OR THE "BETWEEN" then how can it bear affective / moral terms like lack guilt fault debt etc. .. risks thrusting us back into the PERSOn and the INDIVIDUAL (exactly what esposito looks to avoid). ...

“an especially acute problem for a thinker who wants to argue that, in this day and age, “the entire world seems increasingly to be a body united by a single global threat that holds it together and at the same time risks smashing it to pieces,” that “a single destiny binds the world, the whole world, and its life. Either the world will find a way to survive together, or it will perish as one” (76)” (Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 146)

(Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 147) problem ^ clarified via Derrida's distinction between lack and absense .. lack is nostalgic ..  
absence affirmed without nostalgia (nietzcshean dance / laughter) ...  
Fritsch explicates differance  
differential relation and endles deferall ..  
  
SO for Derrida: **“the relation between identity and its other is not exclusionary of a clearly demarcated ‘outside,’ as for Derrida identity is not so much marked by excluding defined others, but by the infinite porosity of a supposed inside and outside, and hence its constant re-negotiation”**

(Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 148) ok ^ so (1) "time is thus constitutive of the problem of the system/environment relationship for Derrida as it is for systems theory" .. so back to Kauffman ^^^  
we can say that "the formal element of a system can never be characterized by any kind of basal simplicity because its meaning depends upon the real-time dynamic state of the system in which the element functions"  
  
sovereignty always tries to contract duration into an instant ..  

(Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 148) (2) Esposito: mortal finitude = reciprocal care ... care not interst grounds community ..  
ok so this is Derridean insofar as it defines community via the spaces between "witH" and "between" ..  
but denies Derrida insofar as he reinscribes a "being-able" that treats finitude as fault wound perversion etc. ????

“our finitude not just as embodied and vulnerable beings who need care but also as ones who, to enter into communicative relations and social bonds with others at all, are by necessity subjected to the “not me” and “not ours” of semiotic systems characterized by différance and the trace that, as Derrida puts it, must “be extended to the entire field of the living, or rather to the life/death relation, beyond the anthropological limits of ‘spoken’ language” (Derrida and Roudinesco 2004, 63).8” (Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 148)

(Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 149) (3) recall ^ Esposito on immunity / community ..  
communitas turns invidiuals insid eout, frees them to their exterioirtiy .  
immunitas brings the outside inside ..  
..  
what wolfe shows is that there is a problem here since this pictur ereifies the inside outside binary i.e., misses  
(1) Infinite porosity & constant renegotiation of inside/outside (Fritsch)  
and (2) second order systems theory ... recall discussion of autopoiesis ^^ not as solipsistic, but as adaptive (?) ... that is that sstems face environment sof greater complexity than they can process, so this necesitates self-referetial closure and autopoiesis?

“the more systems build up their own internal complexity through recursive self-reference and closure, the more linked they are to changes in their environments to which they become more and more sensitive. They can buy more time in relation to environmental change, as it were, but there is also more to respond to.” (Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 149) ^

“we can now see more clearly the cascade of problems that eventuates from Esposito’s seemingly innocent and commonsensical assertion that “we have always existed in common”—an assertion that not only seems counterfactual in light of the question of “world” as rearticulated through work in biological systems theory reaching back to Uexküll but that also raises the question of “from what Archimedean vantage point is such an assertion to be made, surmounting as it appears to do, the constraints and finitude of self-reference?”” (Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 149) so espositos claim that we have always existed im common raises problem of  
  
(1) counterfactuality and (2) archimedean prblem

(Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 149) ^ an alternative starting point begins with difference and alterity .. (?)

“not only is there no kingdom of différance, but différance instigates the subversion of every kingdom” (Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 149)

(Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 150) ^ so because of this (diffreence subverting every kingdom) thinking the political is inseperable from thinking thinking difference and vise versa ...  
so sovereignty (remember, self-same, or ipseity) .. is power that attemepts to give itself its own law .. derrida shows instability here ofc ....

(Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 150) back to Grebowicz and national parks ...  
national boundaries and "nature" and "wilderness" are mapped onto eachother, producing the illusion of demoncracy / wildeerness policy as natural / transcendental ..

(Weinstein and Colebrook, 2017, p. 150) so remember we are  
(1) subverting esposito's affirmative biopolitics  
(2) critiquing "everything is connected" idea  
and (3) connecting to derrida on soverignty ...


# "The Subject and Power"

[[Foucault\|Foucault]]'s objective has not been an analysis of power, but a history of the MODES in which human beings are made subjects (objectivizing, dividing, turning ourselves into subjects). This question arises insofar as philosophy now must guard against the excesses of political rationality, e.g., the way states manage populations, not by putting reason on trial as the Frankfurt School does, but by investigating the SPECIFIC FORMS OF RATIONALITY TIED TO MODERN POWER in historical emergence. (To say the opposite, that Foucault is doing an analysis of power, would seem to say that he's doing an analysis of some metaphysical "thing" that is power). So, Foucault says that contemporary struggles target power effects at the level of bodies, identities, and subjectification, revealing power as both individualizing and totalizing — a function inherited from Christian PASTORAL POWER and redeployed by the modern state, where knowledge is simultaneously massifying (population) and individualizing (the individual). Power is not derived from institutions; institutions governmentalize power rather than generate it, it is already rooted in the whole network of the social.

---

(327-8)
- Foucault's objective has not been an analysis of power, but a history of the MODES in which human beings are made subjects  
- modes:
	- (1) objectivizing of the speaking (productive) subject
	- (2) dividing practices (mad sane, sick healthy)
	- (3) turning ourselves into subjects, e.g., sexuality (is this the way INSTITUTIONS enact this in us? we enter into political institution and become a political subject?)
- power did not have tools of study as did production (economics) and signification (linguistics)
	- he makes these points in *the order of things* on "labor, life, and language"
- a theory of power is necessitated by a constant checking of the conceptualization that undergirds theorization and critical thought ...
- this constant checking relates to the historical conditions of our conceptualization (not just the conceptualization as part of a theory of the object) and related to the type of reality with which we are dealing
- rise of the question of power should not be surprising, it is part of our experience, most pathologically in fascism and Stalinism (again, this similar view from *society must be defended* lecture eleven, that these are not radically different ideas, they are part of our political rationality) ...

---

(329)
- Foucault rethinking power arrangements ...
- for Kant philosophy restrains reason (critique in a Kantian sense, see *posthumous life* introduction) ... philosophy now must guard against the excesses of political rationality, e.g., the way states manage populations
- this connection between rationalization and political excess is obvious ↑ but Foucault says we shouldn't put reason on trial (Frankfurt school does ... they trace enlightenment rationality mutating into domination) ... 
- instead, Foucault wants to investigate the SPECIFIC FORMS OF RATIONALITY TIED TO MODERN power, e.g., in historical emergence
	- caring about specific rationalities rather than "rationalization" as a generalized process (again, Foucault as power atomist)
- analyzing power relationships via antagonism of strategies (and forms of resistance), not just internally (e.g., understanding sanity via insanity)

---

(330-1)
- what can we recognize as common to (recent) oppositions to power? it is not enough to say that they are just anti-authority  
	- (1) they are not bound to one country, not one form of government
	- (2) these struggles target power effects as such (in medical profession, in relation to control over bodies, not just profit-making)
	- (3) these struggles are immediate, they look for the immediate enemy, and do not expect solution at future date
	- (4) these are contradictory: strip autonomy and bestow autonomy ... deindividualization and re-communalization (dictated by institution / power relations)
	- (5) element of secrecy (held by regime of power)
	- (6) these struggles are about INDIVIDUALS
- power is about individualizing, identity, SUBJECTIFICATION
	- subject in two senses
	- (1) subject to someone else,
	- (2) regarding self-knowledge, conscience, identity, etc. 
	- "Both meanings suggest a form of power that subjugates and makes subject to"

---

(332-3)
- struggles and resistance to subjectification (ethnic, social, religious) are becoming more important compared to struggles against domination / exploitation (this is not a historical novelty though)
- a critique may arise arguing that mechanisms of subjection are merely derived from other economic / social processes ... but Foucault says no
	- these struggles prevail since 16th century because the state is often thought of as ignoring individuals in favor of the totality (populations) ...
	- but Foucault says the states power is both individualizing and totalizing INSOFAR AS IT INTEGRATES PASTORAL POWER (power technique originating in Christian institutions)
	- Christianity has been noted as instituting new code of ethics BUT Foucault says, also NEW POWER RELATIONS
		- first to organize as a Church. where INDIVIDUAL SERVES OTHERS AS PASTOR ... "pastor" here designates special form of power since it:
			- (1) has to do with individual salvation in next world
			- (2) opposite of royal power (which demands sacrifice), it is prepared to sacrifice life for flock
			- (3) looks after each individual, not just community
			- (4) necessitates exploration of souls, innermost secrets, etc.
- PASTORAL POWER ↑ has though almost disappeared or lost its efficacy ...
- two aspects of pastoral power: 
	- (1) ecclesiastical institutionalization (which has disappeared)
	- (2) its function (which has spread beyond)

---

(329)
- the modern state as a new form of pastoral power .. sophisticated structure that integrated individuals under specific conditions ... in this process pastoral power is:
	- (1) no longer about next world
	- (2) more officials of power, including the state and the mobilization of the family, and medical institutions 
	- (3) this (1&2) → development of knowledge in two roles, "one, globalizing and quantitative, concerning the population; the other, analytical, concerning the individual" (as with disciplinary and regulatory, anatamo-politics and bio-politics)
- ↑ this is pastoral biopower of the church spreading into the social body

---

(336)
- [[Kant\|Kant]]'s "what is enlightenment" (1784) is the first time a historical event (contemporary one) is treated as something to be philosophically investigated
- ([[Descartes\|Descartes]] asks "who am I" .. Kant, "who are we?" at this moment .. not a universal subject)  
- this aspect pops up in Hegel, Nietzsche, etc.
- now, instead of discovering what we are, we refuse what we are ...
- liberation must be from individualization, subjectification, etc.  

---

(339)
- Foucault warns against treating power as "power as such" (as a metaphysical thing) ... instead,  begin with the question "how"
- distinctions between capacities (abilities over things or bodies), communication (the exchange of signs and meanings), and power relations ...
- here Foucault is at pains to distinguish power relations and communication, e.g., so that power does not become an all-subsuming category

---

(343)
- some issues with just analyzing power relationship via institutions  
	- (1) may mischaracterize reproductive mechanisms for power relations
	- (2) may mistakenly interpret the origins and explanation of power relations as laying within (or stemming from) institutions
	- (3) risk of exaggerating one of the two elements of institution (regulations and apparatus).. and therefore seeing in power relations only some sense of these relations

> “This is not to deny the importance of institutions in the establishment of power relations but, rather, to suggest that one must analyze institutions from the standpoint of power relations, rather than vice versa.”

> “Power relations are rooted deep in the social nexus, not a supplementary structure over and above “society” whose radical effacement one could perhaps dream of. To live in society is, in any event, to live in such a way that some can act on the actions of others. A society without power relations can only be an abstraction.”

> “Instead, I would say that the analysis, elaboration, and bringing into question of power relations and the “agonism ” between power relations and the intransitivity of freedom is an increasingly political task — even, the political task that is inherent in all social existence.”

---

(345)
- power relations have:
	- (1) a system of differentiations that permit action upon the other (e.g., juridical, economic differences)
	- (2) various types of objectives
	- (3) various instrumental modes (e.g., threat of arms, speech, surveillance, etc.)
	- (4) various forms of institutionalization (e.g., closed apparatus, family, legal structures, military, multi-apparatus system ... etc.)
	- (5) various degrees of rationalization
- so, “power relations are rooted in the whole network of the social,” and analysis of power relations cannot be reduced to study of institutions for this reason ...
- the state does not generate power (power is not DERIVED from them), but they GOVERNMENTALIZE IT (in pedagogical, judicial, economic, or family systems)

---

regarding power and strategy (348)
- there are power relations and strategy relations ("choice of winning solutions")
- power wants to be strategy and vice versa
- i.e., power is never so neat ... resistance is possible ...

> "Every power relationship implies, at least in potentia, a strategy of struggle, in which the two forces are not superimposed, do not lose their specific nature, or do not finally become confused. Each constitutes for the other a kind of permanent limit, a point of possible reversal."
# "Different Spaces"

[[Foucault\|Foucault]]

---

(175-6)
- movement from 19th century thinking temporally, to 20th century thinking spatially (structuralism: set of relations, configuration)
- but spatial thinking is not novel ... e.g., middle ages sacred and profane places, protected places, etc. ... cosmological theory, etc.

> “It was this whole hierarchy, this opposition, this interconnection of places that constituted what might be called, very roughly, medieval space — a space of localization.” 

- so when Galileo discovers earth to rotate around sun, he really discovers an infinitely open space so that medieval space is dissolved
	- EXTENSION SUPPLANTS LOCALIZATION

---

(177)
- now, EMPLACEMENT replaces extension (not about absolute localization or continuous extension, but about CONFIGURATIONS, series trees lattices, etc.) ... e.g., ENGINEERING, DEMOGRAPHICS
- again, now, space > time ... time as just a potential distribution of space ...  
- but while time was desacralized in 19th century, space has not yet been (maybe only theoretically in Galileo)

> “we are living not in a homogeneous and empty space but, on the contrary, in a space that is laden with qualities, a space that may also be haunted by fantasy.”

- ↑ phenomenologists show that space is not neutral / empty

---

(178)
- Foucault shifts the focus to the space OUTSIDE us, where life unfolds, time erodes us, and history takes place ...
- this space also is not a void, it is made up of heterogenous emplacements
- these are an ensemble of relations, NOT empty coordinates / absolute position (e.g., transit stations, cafe, movie theater, beaches)

> “But what interests me among all these emplacements are certain ones that have the curious property of being connected to all the other emplacements, but in such a way that they suspend, neutralize, or reverse the set of relations that are designated, reflected, or represented by them. Those spaces which are linked with all the others, and yet at variance somehow with all the other emplacements, are of two great types.”

- ↑ two types:
	- (1) utopias: emplacements with no real place (they are not real)
	- (2) heterotopias: sorts of actually realized utopias in which all emplacements of a culture at simultaneously expressed, reversed etc.  ... outside all places, but actually localizable ... paradoxical in some sense

> “The mirror functions as a heterotopia in the sense that it makes this place I occupy at the moment I look at myself in the glass both utterly real, connected with the entire space surrounding it, and utterly unreal — since, to be perceived, it is obliged to go by way of that virtual point which is over there."

- ↑ so, the mirror as a utopia in the sense that there is this virtual, unreal component of it (image of myself), and the mirror as heterotopia in the sense that the mirror itself is an entirely real thing ("due to the mirror i discover myself absent at the place where i am")

---

(179)
- how to describe heterotopias?
	- would need to describe how these other spaces contest space MYTHICALLY and REALLY
- (1) two major types of heterotopias:
	- (1) CRISIS heterotopias: in primitive societies (they have al but disappeared now, but still remnants) .. sacred places for times of crisis (e.g., women in labor), secondary schools, military service, honeymoon trip defloration
	- (2) now being replaced by heterotopias of DEVIATION: places where individuals are placed insofar as their behavior deviates from norms (psychiatric hospitals, prisons) ...  
		- old peoples homes as between crisis and deviation
	- (these are heterotopias because they are spaces that are apart from ordinary spaces but are tied to them (i.e., they exist, they are different from an everyday (homogenous) space, and they create some relation of mirroring and contestation with society)
- (2) heterotopias may have an existence, and then a society may operate that existing heterotopia differently (heterotopias are society and culture specific in the way they operate)  
	- (e.g., cemeteries were central in 19th century, actual remains were secondary ... in modernity, when belief of afterlife is deadened, focus is placed on actual remains .. and then, cemeteries are argued to be source of disease, etc. ... )
- (3) (ordinary spaces have one function) heterotopias (can) juxtapose several emplacements that are incompatible (contradictory) in themselves (e.g. theater and cinema brings onto the stage unrelated succession of places .... or e.g., garden, in Persian tradition it is a microcosm of all parts of the world)
- (4) heterotopias are not only spatial, they are connected with temporal discontinuities (they open onto heterochromia. different chronology, different temporality) ...
	- i.e., heterotopia functions when we are at a break with traditional temporality (e.g., cemetary)  
	- some heterotopias accumulate time indefinitely (museums in the western 19th century, desire to accumulate all forms, times, etc. in one place)
	- OPPOSITE this, some heterotopias are linked to time at its most chronic (not eternitary), e.g., festivals
- (5) "Heterotopias always presuppose a system of opening and closing that isolates them and makes them penetrable at the same time" ... 
	- e.g., south American farm guest rooms where travelers could sleep but never gained access to the heart of the family (mirrored in American motel rooms with mistresses) .. insofar as there is a reinforcement of exclusion bound to these spaces
- (6) heterotopias have a function in relation to the other spaces ...
	- they are between the poles of creating (1) spaces of illusion (denounce all real space (emplacements) as being even more illusory) (e.g., brothels) or (2) spaces of compensation (meticulous and ordered, that compensates for the disorder of real space) (perhaps, e.g., colonies)

> “Brothels and colonies were two extreme types of heterotopia, and if you consider, for example, that the ship is a piece of floating space, a Different Spaces placeless place, that lives by its own devices, that is self-enclosed and, at the same time, delivered over to the boundless expanse of the ocean, and that goes from port to port, from watch to watch, from brothel to brothel, all the way to the colonies in search of the most precious treasures that lie waiting in their gardens, you see why for our civilization, from the sixteenth century up to our time, the ship has been at the same time not only the greatest instrument of economic development, of course (I'm not talking about that subject today), but the greatest reservoir of imagination. The sailing vessel is the heterotopia par excellence.”

# "Indifference," *Agamben*

Colebrook reads Agamben as rejecting the dominant ethical scheme in which goodness equals difference and evil equals indifference. But also as against Nietzsche’s dissolving of value into will to power (a positive force). Instead, Agamben thinks of INDIFFERENCE as a potentiality — not a lack, but a zone prior to binary distinction. There is “no self who wills,” only an indistinction from which selves, forces, and differences emerge ... so Politics, therefore, is not grounded in life or a basic unit (individual or community) but is always the formation of life through a state of exception: power operates by producing a split that is never fully distinct (human-animal, bios-zoē ... ). **So, politics has always been biopolitics**. Agamben’s task is not to recover a proper politics or ethics, but to expose a form-of-life irreducible to identity, dignity, or personhood— a singular “this here” whose ethical force lies in impotentiality, in the capacity not to actualize. Art, poetry, and language (Titian paintings, art industry, etc.) matter insofar as they stage the emergence of relation from indifference, revealing humanity not as essence or mastery (but not not essence (?)), but as a fragile threshold where distinction can always fail

---

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 157) there has been a dominant thought that goodness isdifference (identity comes through difference)  
evil is indifference.  
...  
so, agambens project as beyond good and evil  
  
but in a manner opposed to that of nietzshce ...  
SINCE neitzschge dissolved god good right true proper etc into will to power. ... agamben resists this, resists dissolving it all into a creative positive force ...begins from OTHER than the will to power). ..  
...  
that is Agamben wants to think of indifference as a potentiality that is not exhausted by the creation of binary differences.  
  
....  
(cf Levinas?)

“There is not a self who wills, nor is there sorne force or will from which selves emerge; rather, there is an indistinction or indifference such that one cannot trace forces, relations, and differences back to sorne differentiating ground or field. Thus, confronted with what has traditionally been dismissed as evil or inauthentic - such as the human being who does not assert his will, his rights, his reason, or speech and identity - Agamben argues for this "life" as the new horizon for ethics.” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 157)

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 158) no self who wills, or force or will from which self emerges ... only indistinction and indifference ..  
ethics begins by revealing that the "good" is a grasping of evil and authetic / proper is nothing other than inauthentic / improper ...  
this marks out a community without any IDENTITY, exprorirated all identity  ..

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 158) after belief in God / authoriative power ... poltiiacal theory begins with social contract, how politics comes into being ... but still assuems a basic unit (indiviudal) or whole community ...  
in hegel we cant assume a basic unit ... this is agamben's subtle connection to hegel

“Agamben sets himself squarely against the anti-Hegelian tradition that runs from Nietzsche to Foucault and that begins with force and power - or a pure act of difference - and then explains bodies and identities as the outcome of forces; this also means that he sets himself against a politics of agonistics. In political terms, the challenge, for Agamben, is to imagine a genuine or profound politics prior to an already constituted political field:” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 158)

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 159) ^ Agamben + Hegel

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 159) this is an annhilation of the poltical, no longer polity or bodies coming togetehre in an order toward the future .. (?)

“If "man" can be reduced to bare life” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 159)

“This means not only that politics might be different from its actual form, but - more importantly - that politics is a potentiality that is not grounded on life, but cornes into being through the forming of life, establishing a relation that is not so much a secure binary or unity as a zone of indifference or indistinction” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 159)

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 160) agamben wants to show that POLTIICS IS NOT GROUNDED ON LIFE (it comes from a state of exception, no basic unit) AND THEREFORE politics has ALWAYS been THE FORMATION OF LIFE (always been biopolitics)

“What we know as the political might always be abandoned, and it is this absence of political relations (exposed in homo sacer where the human body is placed outside the law's protection and maintenance) that discloses our political potentiality by way of impotentiality.” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 160)

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 161) why does politics arise? its easy to think that we, as humans or whatever, come together via speech nd form language and agreements and laws and governments etc ..  and then we might think that states of emergency are merely a modern negative condition to be decried ...  
agamben insists that there is no prior PROPER politics .. no PROPER and DIRECT relation between lfie and polictics, between life and community etc ... THREE IS NO PROPER POLITICS

“Agamben's emphasis on sovereignty is therefore an emphasis on a splitting that brings a distinction into being but that is never fully distinct: if humans form themselves as political animals and as other than mere life, then they do so by a constant labor or anthropological machine that must mark off a distinction between animalistic biology and humanity.” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 161)

“Before there can be animal rights or the consideration of the ethics of human-animal relations, we need to think of the force that divides human animality or life into the human and the nonhuman;” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 161)

“The reason why Agamben so frequently talks about all these domains in terms of sovereignty - the reason why the problems of politics, art, language, animality, and theology aU come down to a logic of the state of exception - has to do with his specific daim about the relation between history and thinking.” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 161)

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 162) remember, agamben in convo with the super common post hegelian french tradtittion (kojeve bataille). ...  
Hegel has vision of difference where ultimately we realize negativity, reasion is just negativity recognizing tslef, huans are just the moment of recognizign this negativity ...  
deconstruction and Foucault as an imaging of a "more dissonant difference which did not resolve itself into one self-recognizing humanity" .. (foucault critique of biopolitics)

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 162) AGAMBEN DOESNT TRY TO THINK OF ANOTHER DIFFERENTIAL POWER ... instead, how do we think about the indifferennce, pre-relational zone for poetnaial difference , etc. ..  
(every problem of potentiality has been haunted by an, underconfronted, problem of impotentiality) ...

“If, today, there can be biopolitics, this is not because of some inexplicable or contingent reversal in human politics, but because that which defines the human as human - speech, politics, community, elevation above mere life - is precarious, and is always in a relation of ongoing exclusion of the supposedly non-human mere life” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 162)

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 163) 3 different ways to think about biopilitics  
(1) alarming loss of proper politics (habermas)  
(2) no retrieval of "proper" politics, instead think of biopolitics as releasing humans from their enslavement to material and localized production (hardt, negri)

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 164) (3) for agamben, "there can be a future politics that is neither an extension of our biological/ animal existence, nor a purely reflective politics that takes no account of our strange imbrication with our bare or animal existence" ..  
the possibility of biopolitics comes from something potetnially inhuman / non-human in  th every constitution of the human ...

“To consider indifference is to refuse that there is a simple split or binary between animality and humanity:” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 164)

“rediscovery of a form-of-life” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 164)

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 165) there is no distinct quality of "man" that is our essence ..  
instead, zone of indiosticntion .. politics must nut be a means oriented toward som,e assuuemd end, but rather, confrontation with indiffrence ... no PROPER outcome ...  
tbis is a rethining of being and praxis: no praxis that BRINGS into b eing ... rather, a practice that is DESTITUENT ..  
GOD as POWER/PRACTICE that is pure existence, bring essencees into being, purely creative (our current pilitics dericved from this ... but not simply .. original problems were already paradoxical .. (???) ..  
DESTITUENT power/practice is DECREATIVE ...

“Here, again, Agamben differs both from Foucault - for whom "life" was a modern concept, and for whom there were no essential problems outside a history of varying and reconfigured discursive distributions - and frorn Jacques Derrida's deconstruction, which Agamben criticized for not stepping outside the limits of language to pose the problem of the passage from silence to speech. The theological problem, one that Agamben describes as a problem of "economy," concerns how a being that is complete and self-sufficient, requiring nothing other than itself in order to be, nevertheless both creates a world and then proceeds to act in the world. For Agamben, fuis relates to a broader problern of the relation between potentiality and actualization (or, in Greek philosophical parlance, dynamis and energeia (HS: 31-2; Ugilt 2014: 23))” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 165)

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 166) god is all powerful but created world ... this cant be NECESSARY .. or else that would mean god is constrained by something ...  
there must be a god of complete power AND this must not be dinished by his creativity  
(analogy with speech: we speak and convey content to the other but this distribution is not a loss?)

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 166) agamben compares this ^ to, e.g., a soverignty that is not subject tot he law but generates the relation between a power to give or withhold law ... god-like in terms of pure freedom / power ..  
BUT also due to complete freedom may appear completely contignet, without sense, etc. ...  
..  
zone of indiffrence between complete freewdom and contingency ..  
cf biopolitics.

“And this is how we might conceive the ambivalence of biopolitics and the state of exception: the emergence of a force that is no longer limited by law and the conception of a life that is nothing other than substance to be managed are both nihilistic abandonments of the capacity to form and create a politieal space, but they are also exposures of the problem of life: nothing guarantees the emergence of humanity, law, or rights. To imagine that, by virtue of being human, we are ail, always, already citizens of rights and speech is to forget the genesis of politics from a site of force that may or may not issue in the creative and practical production of a political space, of community, of art, or speech. The state of emergency of the present may be the opportunity for a new thought of politics, art, and humanity - a thought that neither asswnes the inevitability of the· good life on the basis of "man's" natural being, nor abandons all conceptions ofpolitical becomingby falling back on sorne supposed naturallife that has already exhausted its potential in being nothing more than mere or bare life.” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 166)

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 166) state of emergency as opportunity to not think of pursit of GOOD life, "mans" natural being ..  
AND ALSO not fall back on mere / bare life .. (?)

“For Agamben, life cannot be that which inevitably arrives at its prope~ expression in human reason, and so there can be no grounding of politics on naturalism. At the same time, politics as speech, freedom, and practice have always been secured by way of excluding a bare life that can never be fully mastered, captured, or evaded. It is this process of distancing and differentiation, this opening of the politieal field, that Agamben finds in the sovereign decision, the work of art, and the crises of contemporary states of emergency.” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 166)

“move beyond both a liberalism that focuses on a universal subject and a focus on texts, language, and constructed social systems” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 167)

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 167) continental (phenomenology, strucutralism) and analytic (linguistic turn, american) have refused to ground thought in something like a natural proper "man" ...  
  
more recently there has been a turn back to naturalism ..

“To speak schematically, we might say that post-humanism tries to diminish the distinction between human and non-human, whereas antihumanism problematizes both the distinction and any notions of continuity or sameness.” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 168)

“problem of the human being at the center of his thought.” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 168)

“Derrida's project, for ail its complexity, might nevertheless be characterized by two tendencies: first, like Agamben, he insists neither on a simple destruction of the human by way of a simple return to one generallife of animality, but instead suggests that the border between human and animal needs to be continuaily renegotiated because of the complexity both of animal life and of Western thought, which cannot simply free itself from its anthropocentric determinations. Second, Derrida's approach is broadly deconstructive, and this is where he would differ from Agamben. Deconstruction is "not a method" precisely because it instails itself in a given textual complex and then exposes the mechanisms by which a text constitutes its operative differences; it then exposes those differences as both necessary and impossible. Derrida's main point of reference for his theorization of animaIs is therefore the Western philosophical tradition and its constant reliance on a distinction between man and animal, even if that distinction is under continual pressure from within. Ail those features that supposedly render man distinct - language, gesture, communication, community - are also definitive of some forms of animality; and ail those features that would render the animal secondary and separate, such as a certain relationship between the animal's body and a world that is not lived as a meaningful horizon of projects, already invade the human.” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 169)

“In his talks on sovereignty, Derrida, unlike Agamben, focuses less on sorne generallogic of sovereignty and more on the textual articulation of the problem of the sovereign, and the concept of sovereignty's dependence on figures of the beast or animal (Derrida 2009” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 170) see also Wolfe's essay on island and ecology and derrida ..

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 170) derrida INSTALLS himself in text to reveal aporia .. logical contradiction etcs ..  
for derrida, the traiditon cannot fully escape anthroipocentrism ..  
agaben gives speculative positive reading ..aims to recover traces .. imagine new poissiblirtes ..  
//  
derrida wants to m,ake uis DOUBt concept like soverignty human animal etc. .  
  
agamben ants to show that the threshhold (indifference, state of exception, homo sacer) is not merely a textual problem BUT INSTEAD A STRUCTURAL ORIGINARY CON DITION ... new ground for thjinking

“The key concept in von Uexküll's work is the Umwelt, which if translated as Ilenvironment" maintains the sense of Ilenviron" or surround. The key critical force of the concept of the Umwelt lies in the sense of the body's capacities and relations: it is not the case that there is a world that is then represented by a body. Rather, it is the body's responsive potentials that yield a specifie world, or Umwelt. In the famous example of the tick cited by von Uexküil, the insect's world is composed of three possibilities of disturbance and response: skin, uric acid, and blood prompt the tick to fail on to a body and take in blood to the point of satiety. uPerception" or "having a world" is less akin to a camera taking a distanced snapshot of sorne common world, and closer to a functional coupling. This is so much so that a bee whose abdomen is eut open will continue to consume nectar, precisely because the usual bodily response of filling never arrives.” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 170)

“Such a theory renders problematic the notorious daim by Heidegger that an animal "has no world": for Heidegger, the human world is not sorne domain of objects or matter that we then choose to perceive, for the human world is given in meaningful projects. But we might say that an animal has an animal's world, made up of the animal's capacities.” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 171)

“Agamben's approach to the humananimal binary is neither to resolve nor deconstruct the divide, but to intensify the divide - to sharpen the difference between humanity and animality - and then to locate the problem of that difference within humanity.” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 171)

“For Agamben, there is something distinctly human, and something that is increasingly threatened, in the biopolitical reduction of alliife to bare life. What distinguishes humanity is not an actual difference from animality, but a potentiality to differentiate - a potentiality (like ail potentialities) that is in part a capacity not to differentiate. Indeed, arguing that it is necessary to abandon the "mysterious metaphysical" conjunction of man and animal, Agamben instead offers a vision of the human as a perpetual antagonism between these two incompatible spheres, a space where "ceaseless divisions" occur” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 171)

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 172) agamben tends to identify opposing problems, mainntain and refuse both sides, avoid a middle path ..  
  
sharpen diff between animal and human, and then locate the problem of that difference within humaity ..  
turn to linneaus

“Both Derrida and Agamben refuse to maintain the human-animal distinction in its simplicity, and both refuse to collapse the human into the animal altogether, but this is for quite different and significant reasons: for Derrida, this is because the animal-human difference is multiple, to the point that one could not refer simply to "the" animal, and this multiplication of differences means that even though we cannot avoid the concept of the human, every text will require a reading that exposes the dependence of the human on a series of differences that cannot be contained. By contrast, Agamben's work maintains a profound sense of the human-animal distinction outside the textual history of metaphysics. The texts he reads are not responsible for differentiating humans from animals, but they do disclose a profound problem of human life and its relation to an animality that is its most intimate truth. To this extent there is sorne truth to Agamben's objection to deconstruction - that it stops short at the textual traces that mark out differences, without interrogating the genesis of difference. In this case the human-animal distinction, or what Agamben refers to as the "anthropological machine," is possible because of a deeper problem of animality that might also be seen to disclose a deeper problem of potentiality. The problem with animality lies in the concept of the Umwelt: what the animal is occurs by way of relation. One dominant response to phenomenology - both Heidegger's work, and theories of animality such as von Uexküll's - has therefore been to stress the significance and irreducibility of systems and relations, such that we do n0t have the world on the one hand and then living beings on the other. Rather, life just occurs as one relational system, with each living being realizing itself through relations. Agamben, however, wants to think the potentiality for relations prior to the actualization of relations. In terms of animality: if we defin.e the human as the potential to distance oneself from animality, to take u” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 172)

“That is, rather than look at humans and animaIs in their difference, one might look at humans at the point when that difference is not achieved.” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 172) cf soul blindness?

“If animality is a life that we know only as the most distanced and also the most intimate, then -like Derrida - there may be no such thing as "the" animal, and what we may confront when we think of animality is not a thlng, nor a relation, but a potentiality for relations, a threshold. This is why Agarnben's short work on the relation between man and animal is at once about relations, and yet is not about a relation between a being and its lived and meaningful world but about a capacity to enter into relation - hence the concept of "the open." At the sarne time, the book - though frarned by the problem of a being coming into relation - is also about the nonrelational, and concludes not with the animal as a silent being without world or sense, but with a human confrontation with this relation toward non-relational "silence."” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 173)

“prior to the animal-human relation there is something like animality, and this animality in tum is something like a potential for coming into relation, a potential that is given most profoundly when that relation breaks down” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 173)

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 173) bee example demonstrates significance of coupling, that is, that life is relational ..  
but also that the potential for life is JUST A POTENTIAL

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 174) the animal is "poor in world" because they cant take up a relation to these potentials ^ ...  
but this non relation is PROFOUND .. it is not purely negative, it forms a sort of openness (O, 55)  
...  
so animal cant be idsmissed for agamben

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 176) sum ^^^  
for Heidger .. humanity arises in relation to world  
world is lived, not represented (we are THROWN into world)  
only BREAKDOWN reveals worldhood  
..  
so, humans usually live inauthentically, absorbed in world taking it as simply there .  
BUT when the “givenness” of the world collapses (through boredom, Angst, or disruption), the self is forced to confront its own potentialiy ...  
THIS is authenticity ..  
relations become “inoperative,” revealing the potential for meaning-making itself ...  
  
-> moods  
...  
for Agamben, human is defined in proximity to animal ...

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 176) heidegger always wants to show that HUMAN is not just animal + rationality ... DASEIN is a specific relation, not aform of biological life ..

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 176) agamben is indebted to heidegger insofar as  
  
(1) "a seeming accident or inessential failure for something to arrive at its potential discloses the true nature of the potential"  
(2) "we cannot, then, dismiss the accident as standing outside what something is; man is distinguished from animality not by a distinct quality but by a mode of relation, a relation that appears only when actual humanity breaks down."  
...  
agamben really wants to interreogate humanity as a relation to animality .. as a relation to the non-relational ..

“If humans are defined by Heidegger as a pure relation or a pure becoming - as the time through which the world is unfolded - then Agamben sees humans as being most definitively human when they are drawn back to an animality or non-relationality that they had only seemingly excluded” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 176)

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 177) death limits and defines potentiality since death is what precludes me from achieving everything (temporal and spatial limtis) ...   
there is an utter singularity of Dasein from this .. i am dignified because of this ..  
.  
agamben confronts the singuarity that befalls humans in situations of exposed life (concentration camps, e.g.) ...reduced to bare life

“Such a life is singular in being irreducible to the biologicallife to which Nazism wanted to reduce it, and yet also not fully articulated or given meaning through testimony.” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 177)

“It is this life that Agamben deems to be the challenge of ethics. As long as we remain attached to the ethics of persons, and to humanity as a life-transcending being of dignity, then it would follow that mere life could be exterminated or sacrificed without any sense of violation. How might we begin to think ethically if, instead of only valuing the mode of life that is not bare life we were to ask about an ethics of life that does not rely on the dignity or personality of life?” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 177) !!!

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 178) ^^^^^^^ there is animality in paradise (metaphorical .. )

“Toward the conclusion of The Open, Agamben therefore departs dramatically from Heidegger's conception of authentic and decisive taking up of one's own world and instead looks to a point weil beyond the language of being, and weil beyond the idea of redeeming our failen and inauthentic loss of world:” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 178)

“not a term from which relations inevitably unfold” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 179)

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 179) humanity as potentiality (this is back to beggining to this chapter), there is no basic political unit ... so -> a community (which we already said is not united by some identity) BASED ON WHATEVER BEING .. this is not the liberal political self opposite animality .. not what relations unfold from  
.. WHATEVER BEING IS A LIFE NOT YET IDENTIFIED OR DIGNIFIED OR ACTUALIZED .. it is INDIVIDUATED.. it is not bare life that is opposed to political identity  .. .PRIOR to idenity there is singularity of being here .. prior to belonging to named set ..  
life is attended to in it singularity

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 179) this pic is diff from heidegger (see bottom 178, start of this para): think about all of opposite heidegger on authenticity and decisive taking up of world?

“The Titian canvas presents two loyers whose silent contemplation of each other exposes them (and the viewer of the painting, presumably) to the unique relation of love, in which each body allows itself to view and be viewed as singular life. This is not the life of the political individual or modem person who has dignity and worth because of certain qualities, nor is it the bodily life that is deemed to be other than, or nothing more than the condition for, individual and rational humanity. The canvas displays the mute experience of being in relation before and outside of constituted and formalized relations. The tum to art at the end of The Open is not framed by Agamben as a specifie claim about the force of art, or the force of the image, or even the force of love; it functions as a gesture: not yet a concept or repeatable meaning freed from the materiality of its expression. The loyers offer an example of love as a singular 1/this here," which expresses a profound capacity to experience life without elevating that life to some general category of personhood. Agamben refers to art at this book's conclusion in order to indicate a pre-political experience of life that might nevertheless point to the possibility of a new politics.” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 180)

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 180) possibility of singular "this here" .. to experience life without elevating to category of personhood .. pre political experience ..

“but rather to show the centréll emptiness, the hiatus that - within man - separates man and animal, and to risk ourselves in this emptiness: the suspension of the suspension, Shabbat of both animal and man.” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 181)

“It is precisely this detachment of poiesis from praxis that Agamben seeks to question, while nevertheless refusing to see praxis as action Indifference 183 grounded in life” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 182)

“Art would be neither the representation of the world, nor the simple act of the artist, but the opening of a relation that also presented itself as the outcome ofwhat might have remained non-relational, a taking place of a singular "whatness" or haecceity” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 184)

“Agamben focuses less on what the poem says, and more on the event that there is saying. At odds with the posthumanism of his contemporaries who question the primacy accorded to language and the privilege it grants to man as a speaking animal, Agamben remains closer to Benjamin in thinking of language as something that remains worthy of reflection, although he rejects Benjamin's almost mystical notion of a language of names where there might be a direct relation between word and experience” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 184)

“Agamben, in this respect, is at odds' with both the structuralist and post-structuralist emphasis on language as a system of signs and differences, an emphasis that was essentially post-human in focusing on structures over agents and speakers. Both structuralism and post-structuralism - for ail their seeming criticisms of man and the individual - nevertheless maintain a liberating notion of literature and text as practices of language that detach words from intention, sense, and speakers, and thereby expose the force of writing, text, and the traces of system. But, in doing so, these projects are complicit with sovereignty's abandonment of all that lies beyond its realm of constituted force: Language's sovereign daim thus consists in the attempt to make sense coincide with denotation, to stabilize a zone of indistinction between the two in which language can maintain itself in relation to its denotata by abandoning them and withdrawing from them into a pure langue (the linguistic "state of exception"). This is what deconstruction does, positing undecidables that are infinitely in excess of every possibility of signification. (HS: 21-2)” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 185)

“For Agamben, such projects that simply accept language as a constitutive system of differences fail to ask the question that is 'most important: how do we account for the emergence of difference from indifference” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 185)

“Poetry is a bringing into being of the distinction of language” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 186)

“Poetry is therefore tied close1y both to the prob1em of potentiality, insofar as it exposes an emergence of speech that is not yet one more move in an aIready constituted system, and also to the prob1em of humanity” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 186)

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 186) good summary of Agamben's tendency .. same tendecny in discussion of man-animal

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 186) at first glance, Agamben is discsuing a upture in our engagement with art ... we lament the fat we no longer approach the world POETRICALLY .. space to be brought into being ,  
  
..  
agamben does not look back to an earlier period of art where it emerged from praxis . never regards contemporary lack as opportunity for return to the PROPPER ..  
there is loss, but no simple pradise to begin with  
->

“Even though Agamben frequently looks back to earlier works of art, such as the Titian canvas that concludes The Open, he is also insistent that his inquiry into zones of indistinction is oriented toward a future that would not be like the past, but would address questions that the past articulated vaguely while never fully exploring them. For Agamben, these questions or indistinctions that were intimated but never clarified have haunted Western thought and yet remain unthought, even in the transition from a theologically dominated mode of culture and politics to an increasing secularism and disenchantment. What Agamben seeks to do is pose these questions again while neither arriving at a clear distinction nor resolving the indistinction into some unity. What is important is to consider the emergence of a relation from a potentiality: there are not humans on the one hand, and linguistic systems on the other, but a potentiality for speaking. It is from that potential for relation that humans emerge, in their distinction, as speaking beings; but this also means that - as potential for relation"":' the difference can also break down.” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 187)

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 187) there are not humans on one side and language on the other .. BUT A POTENTIALITY FOR SPEAKING

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 188) for agamben and heidegger, question of ontology (what is present) must not forget, as part of it, the question of how what is present comes i nto being ...  
for Heidegger, this is time and appearing (phenomenlogy) ..  
fr agamben, it is not phenomenology but POTENTIALITY

“We start to think genuinely about human-animal distinctions precisely when humans become increasingly animalized in biopolitics; only then do we become aware of the "machine" that has always - but never definitively - divided humans from their mere animality. It is when the potentiality for politics is lost that we can rethink the coming into being of the political, a10ng with the coming into being of the human, and the emergence of poetry.” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 189) good descriptin of the importance of MODERN biopolitical movement for Agamben

“This mode of questioning is not ontology; or, it is not ontology in its usual sense: it is not about being but about coming into being, and not about what is - our actual world - but about the potential for actuality and not being” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 189)

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 190) agamben still wants t o think about the question o fessence nad existence (as in aristotle and heidegger) ... but agamben questions the ontological asking of this question .  
.  
if we askl the question in temrs of life instead of ontology, then it changes ..  
.  
in aristotle / heidegger, split between zoe and bios ..  (bios as formed life, proper)  
  
..  
modern reaction to biopolitics is to intensify the split between zoe and bios .. focus on subjectivity perfomativity etc .... call this, linguistic state of exception ..

“His argument was unique precisely because he recognized that using "life" as sorne basis for political decisions would shut down any form of deliberation - but this was not because he did not see life as a legitimate problem. Rather, he wanted to see life neither as a being, something that simply is that could decide our questions of existence, nor as something that could only be known as what lies outside language - but as a potentiality for politics and language while remaining irreducible to either” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 190)

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 190) this (^?) is connectio nbetween contemp biopoltiics and theology ...  
image of God as self determining and complete ..  
so we imagine the (perfect) human seperation from animals to be our supposed (or possible, or theoretical?) capacity for self-determination above our bare life

“ontological because they have already determined what life is:” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 192)

“For A:gamben, that mere life without meaning,. order, law, and completion is precisely where a new ethics and politics might begin. Such a politics would neither be theological by asserting some proper form of law or transcendence, nor nihilistic by abandoning all conceptions of law and resigning itself to a world of nothing more than actual life. Instead, life would be this potentiality for being mere life, which would be a forming, gestural, and paetic life, never coinciding absolutely with itself.” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 192)

“a violence or force that creates an inside and outside” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 193)

(Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 193) Agamben, following Benjamin, rethinks divine or “blessed” theological life ...  
life not as a transcendent origin or law-giving being but as an immanent force . a primordial, non-juridical violence that founds the distinction between life and law /...  
so that life itself, rather than being mere or bare life, bears its own divinity and potential for redemption (?)

“an ethics of humanity that was not aligned with the humanity of reason, personhood, or humanism.” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 193)

“Following Agamben, it might be possible to form an ethics of life where life is not necessarily only worthy insofar as it meets the requirements of dignity and personhood. And, rather than regulate the law's use of force, it might be possible to think of a form or mIe that is not external to life.” (Colebrook and Maxwell, 2016, p. 194)
# *The Open*

[[Agamben\|Agamben]] argues that western politics and philosophy produce “man” by continually dividing human from animal, a division that first runs inside the human itself. This anthropological machine generates bare life and biopolitics by managing that internal caesura. Biopolitics is thus not new to the 17th century, as [[Foucault\|Foucault]] argues.. Agamben’s does not look to reconcile human and animal, but to render the anthropological machine inoperative, opening a space beyond identity, history, and sovereignty — neither human nor animal, neither active nor productive, but a messianic between. He takes this messianic between up in *the coming community*, and in relation to realization.

---

(§1) theriomorphous = having an animal form, e.g., or especially, theriomorphic deities

> “The idea that in the days of the Messiah the righteous, who for their entire lives have observed the prescriptions of the Torah, will feast on the meat of Leviathan and Behemoth without worrying whether their slaughter has been kosher or not is perfectly familiar to the rabbinic tradition. What is surprising, however, is one detail that we have not yet mentioned: beneath the crowns, the miniaturist has represented the righteous not with human faces, but with unmistakably animal heads.”

- the answer to WHY this is is the case has not been concluded upon
- Gnostic ideas of theriomorphous archons and their astrological representations (ascent to heaven)
- but the righteous are not dead, they are the ones alive at the moment of the messiah's coming ...
	- and also, the theriocephalous representations of Gnostic deities ITSELF needs explanation
- going through a series of possible but unsatisfactory answers to this question (e.g., astrology), Agamben suggests that "the theriomorphous depiction of the archons refers directly back to the shadowy kinship between animal macrocosm and human microcosm" 
	- in terms of political theory, Agamben at once holds on to humanity as a political potential, a potential to think of a future in which a space of common speech and practice would yield a difference from the biopolitical reduction of humans to bare biological existence, and yet this community would not be based on some recognition of who "we" are, in common, as an identified nation, tradition, or culture; nor would it transcend biological or animal being. 
		- so, toward the conclusion of *the open*, Agamben therefore departs dramatically from Heidegger's conception of authentic and decisive taking up of one's own world and instead looks to a point well beyond the language of being, and well beyond the idea of redeeming our fallen and inauthentic loss of world ...  
- Agamben does not hold "man" as some basic political unit
- so what are human-animal relations? Agamben looks at a different context in the Talmud, which implies that animal nature will also be transfigured in the messianic kingdom (messianic prophecy of Isaiah)

> “It is not impossible, therefore, that in attributing an animal head to the remnant of Israel, the artist of the manuscript in the Ambrosian intended to suggest that on the last day, the relations between animals and men will take on a new form, and that man himself will be reconciled with his animal nature.”

---

(§2) acephalous = not having a head
- “the end of history involves, then, an “epilogue” in which human negativity is preserved as a “remnant” in the form of eroticism, laughter, joy in the face of death” (see Weinstein-Colebrook *posthumous life*)
- SO, [[Bataille\|Bataille]] and gnostic animal headed gods = model for his BASE MATERIALISM .. mix of human and bestial to challenge spiritual ideals .. 
- this later turns into → ACEPHALE , symbol of escaping the rational HEAD-LED humanity that always risks backsliding into animality ...
- but meanwhile, [[Kojeve\|Kojeve]] taught that when history ends humans stop acting and thinking dialectically and live peacefully as happy, animal-like beings ...
- **THE KEY is that Bataille rejects this calm vision because he believed that experiences like art, love, and laughter still carried a sacred, negative force that could not be reduced to animal life (laughter, eroticism, sacred joy, etc.)**

---

(§3) snob, "no animal can be a snob" - Kojeve
- Kojeve returns to earlier claims about mans return to animality after history ... if this is the case, then art love play etc. lose their human meaning and become mere natural behaviors (e.g., a bird making a nest) ...
- therefore, post-historical humans are not HAPPY but merely CONTENT ...
- this transformation erases human language, replacing it with animal like signals
	- thus philosophy and even the very possibility of wisdom would vanish along with man “properly so called.”
- but for Kojeve this has already happened (the end of history) ... world wars, Nazism, soviet communism, were just the rest of the world catching up ... American way of life represents post-historical existence (man has already become animal)
- but then Kojeve visits Japan and changes view insofar as he saw Japan as a post-historical state that remained distinctly human ...
- not comfort nor satisfaction but PURE SNOBBERY (formalized disciplines like ceremony of tea etc.)
- on Kojeve's account, after history ends there is an ULTRAHISTORICAL phase ... messianic interval between history / eternity ...

> “But what is decisive is that in this ultrahistorical fringe, man’s remaining human presumes the survival of animals of the species Homo sapiens that must function as his support. For in Kojeve’s reading of Hegel, man is not a biologically defined species, nor is he a substance given once and for all; he is, rather, a field of dialectical tensions always already cut by internal caesurae that every time separate—at least virtually—“anthropophorous” animality and the humanity which takes bodily form in it. Man exists historically only in this tension; he can be human only to the degree that he transcends and transforms the anthropophorous animal which supports him, and only because, through the action of negation, he is capable of mastering and, eventually, destroying his own animality (it is in this sense that Kojeve can write that “man is a fatal disease of the animal”).

- but what is the relation between the Japanese snob and his ANIMAL body ... (how does this compare to Bataille's acephalous figure) ...
	- Kojeve's privileging of the aspect of negation between man and animal IGNORES the sense in which the State (modernity) begins to care for his own animal life (call it BIOPOWER, FOUCAULT)
	- ↓

> Perhaps the body of the anthropophorous animal (the body of the slave) is the unresolved remnant that idealism leaves as an inheritance to thought, and the aporias of the philosophy of our time coincide with the aporias of this body that is irreducibly drawn and divided between animality and humanity.”

---

(§4) mysterium disiunctionis = last complete work by Carl Jung ... “mystery of the conjunction” ... as a designation for mystical paradoxes

> “Everything happens as if, in our culture, life were what cannot be defined, yet, precisely for this reason, must be ceaselessly articulated and divided.”

- key turning point is in [[Aristotle\|Aristotle]] de anima ... distinguishes what is "living" via the possession of a soul ... Aristotle then divides life into various faculties / functions .. establishing unity via division
- the isolation of NUTRITIVE / VEGETATIVE LIFE (this is part of the soul which is common to humans and plants) becomes an important event insofar as it establishes a basic layer of life distinct from higher conscious forms ...
- so Bichat later rearticulates human-animal life distinction using nutritive life as base ... (for Bichat there is basically two animals in an organism, organic and external animal ..

> “The successes of modern surgery and anesthesia are founded upon, among other things, just this possibility of dividing and, at the same time, articulating Bichat’s two animals. And as Foucault has shown, when the modern State, starting in the seventeenth century, began to include the care of the population’s life as one of its essential tasks, thus transforming its politics into biopolitics, it was primarily by means of a progressive generalization and redefinition of the concept of vegetative life (now coinciding with the biological heritage of the nation) that the State would carry out its new vocation.”

> “The division of life into vegetal and relational, organic and animal, animal and human, therefore passes first of all as a mobile border within living man, and without this intimate caesura the very decision of what is human and what is not would probably not be possible.”

> “In our culture, man has always been thought of as the articulation and conjunction of a body and a soul, of a living thing and a logos, of a natural (or animal) element and a supernatural or social or divine element. We must learn instead to think of man as what results from the incongruity of these two elements, and investigate not the metaphysical mystery of conjunction, but rather the practical and political mystery of separation. What is man, if he is always the place — and, at the same time, the result — of ceaseless divisions and caesurae? It is more urgent to work on these divisions, to ask in what way — within man — has man been separated from non-man, and the animal from the human, than it is to take positions on the great issues, on so-called human rights and values. And perhaps even the most luminous sphere of our relations with the divine depends, in some way, on that darker one which separates us from the animal."

- so ↑ because the human-animal divide first occurs INSIDE MAN, the concept of “man” and of “humanism” must be rethought as products of this internal separation rather than as stable essences ....
- SO there is an element of Agamben arguing that we should see MAN as what arises from the incongruity between body and soul, living thing and logos, natural and supernatural, social divine, etc. ...

---

(§5) physiology of the blessed
- medieval theologians concerned with how to ensure the IDENTITY between resurrected body and body of the actual life .. does ALL matter part of living body need to be resurrected? ... anxiety here about the continuity or discontinuity (difficulty of thinking about bodily identity once biological function ceases) ...
- this problematic quickly becomes a problem with our idea of the BLESSED body ...
	- Edenic body as the model? before the fall of Adam and Eve ...
	- but then does the blessed share in their sexuality nourishment? how do we conceive of these desires / parts on the blessed body? in the Edenic model ...
- if resurrected could eat and reproduce then humanity's number and form would grow endlessly?  
	- really these functions (Agamben calls nutrition and generation the "two principal functions of animal life") are useless after death ..  
	- this infinite nutrition and generation of the blessed → William of Auvergne’s mock lament Cursed Paradise in which there is so much defecation!”
- some have claimed that the blessed (or resurrected?) would eat and have sex in paradise but not for survival, RATHER as a means of blessing mans bodily and spiritual powers ..
	- [[Aquinas\|Aquinas]] says no to all of this ... resurrection perfects CONTEMPLATIVE not NATURAL life, so no sex or eating ...
	- SO the animal is therefore excluded from paradise (remember Agamben says nutrition and generation are the two principal functions of animal life)

---

(§6) cognitio experimentalis

> “We can, then, advance some provisional hypotheses about what makes the representation of the righteous with animal heads in the miniature in the Ambrosian so enigmatic. The messianic end of history or the completion of the divine *oikonomia* of salvation defines a critical threshold, at which the difference between animal and human, which is so decisive for our culture, threatens to vanish. That is to say, the relation between man and animal marks the boundary of an essential domain, in which historical inquiry must necessarily confront that fringe of ultrahistory which cannot be reached without making recourse to first philosophy. It is as if determining the border between human and animal were not just one question among many discussed by philosophers and theologians, scientists and politicians, but rather a fundamental metaphysico-political operation in which alone something like “man” can be decided upon and produced. If animal life and human life could be superimposed perfectly, then neither man nor animal and, perhaps, not even the divine—would any longer be thinkable. For this reason, the arrival at posthistory necessarily entails the reactualization of the prehistoric threshold at which that border had been defined. Paradise calls Eden back into question”

- ↑ Agamben returns to §1 regarding animal heads ... the image of the righteous with animal heads is puzzling ... BECAUSE IT IS THE END OF HISTORY THAT MARKS a point where the distinction between human and animal threatens to disappear ...
- Aquinas goes on that Adam did not need animals for use (fed on trees of paradise instead, no clothes necessary) but for experimental knowledge
- this is ultimately about defining the nature of man ... what counts as human?
- when this boundary collapses, distinctions dissolve (e.g., concentration camps as experiment in deciding human from inhuman that destroys the very distinction it looks to define)

---

(§7) taxonomies
- fascinated by apes, [[Linnaeus\|Linnaeus]] doubted theologians claim that animals were soulless machines (Descartes) ...
- Linnaeus cant find scientific distinction between ape and human .. (although he says *of course* humans are distinct in their relation to god)
- but ↑ apes had already been grouped with humans .. and language, which was later seen as UNIQUELY human, was thought to be cross species (Locke and parrot) ... earlier, pygmies as anatomical blurring of human and apes ..
- **Linnaeus' originality lies not in his boldness of classification, but RATHER in the way he refrains from attributing specific characteristics to HOMO, writing instead only the philosophical injunction nosce te ipsum (“know yourself”) ...**   
- **so when he later says homo SAPIENS ... this is not a description of biology but of an imperative (know yourself becomes the defining description)**

---

(§8) without rank
- the anthropological machine of humanism, as seen in Pico’s Oration on the Dignity of Man and later in Linnaeus’s taxonomy, ironically reveals that man has no fixed nature or essence — 
- he is defined only by his capacity to take on any form, divine or bestial, so that his humanity depends on a perpetual instability in which he is always more and less than himself
	- a “chameleon” whose lack of a true face is mirrored by, e.g., the wild children of the eighteenth century ... those mute figures who expose how fragile and uncertain the boundary between human and animal truly is ..

---

(§9) anthropological machine
- the anthropological machine —in both its ancient and modern forms — operates by producing a “zone of indifference” between man and animal, including and excluding life at once
	- in the modern version (Haeckel’s Homo alalus, the speechless ape-man) humanity is constituted by animalizing itself through the figure of a non-speaking human
	- in the ancient version (the Homo ferus, slave, barbarian) it is constituted by humanizing the animal
	- both are mechanisms that presuppose the human and perpetually decide its boundary, generating not a true human being but only bare life, a life suspended between inclusion and exclusion ... thus, the entrance of BARE LIFE

---

(§10) umwelt
- [[Uexküll\|Uexküll]]’s concept of the umwelt demonstrates that each animal perceives and interacts with a world uniquely constituted by “carriers of significance,” so that no two perceptual worlds —whether of fly, spider, or human — coincide
- radical incommensurability of subjectivities and the impossibility of entering into relation with an object as such ...  
- but ... ↓ 

> "The two perceptual worlds of the fly and the spider are absolutely uncommunicating, and yet so perfectly in tune that we might say that the original score of the fly, which we can also call its original image or archetype, acts on that of the spider in such a way that the web the spider weaves can be described as “fly-like.” Though the spider can in no way see the Umwelt of the fly (Uexküll affirms—and thus formulates a principle that would have some success—that “no animal can enter into relation with an object as such,” but only with its own carriers of significance), the web expresses the paradoxical coincidence of this reciprocal blindness."

---

(§11) tick
- the tick experiences none of the idyll of a nice summer day, it merely sucks the blood. but it does not even love the blood, it cannot taste, only temperature
- tick has relationship to odor of mammals, temperature of mammals, typology of skin and blood vessels of mammals .. and this is all .. 
	- "yet the tick is immediately united to these three elements in an intense and passionate relationship the likes of which we might never find in the relations that bind man to his apparently much richer world. the tick is this relationship; she lives only in it and for it"

> **"However, at this point Uexküll informs us that in the laboratory in Rostock, a tick was kept alive for eighteen years without nourishment, that is, in a condition of absolute isolation from its environment. He gives no explanation of this peculiar fact, and limits himself to supposing that in that “period of waiting” the tick lies in “a sleep-like state similar to the one we experience every night.” He then draws the sole conclusion that “without a living subject, time cannot exist.” But what becomes of the tick and its world in this state of suspension that lasts eighteen years? How is it possible for a living being that consists entirely in its relationship with the environment to survive in absolute deprivation of that environment? And what sense does it make to speak of “waiting” without time and without world?"**

- how it is possible for a living being to exist entirely in relation to environment but be able to survive with absolute deprivation of that environment ... what can we make of this?

---

(§12) poverty in world, "the behavior of the animal is never an apprehending of something as something" — [[Heidegger\|Heidegger]]
- Heidegger certainly resists definition of the human as "living being + something" e.g., language reason ...  
- instead, dasein ...
- dasein already presupposed in every conception of life ..

> “The animal is closed in the circle of its disinhibitors just as, according to Uexküll, it is closed in the few elements that define its perceptual world. For this reason, as in Uexküll, “when the animal comes into relation with something else, it can only come upon that which ‘affects ’ and thus starts its being-capable. Everything else is a priori unable to penetrate the ring around the animal.” 

- Uexküll replaces idea of single world with many closed umwelten ..  
- human objective world is just our own umwelt .. 
- again, each has carriers of significance, elements that matter to the animal corresponding to its sensory and motor organs ...
	- no animal relates to object AS SUCH, only to what carries meaning in umwelt ..  
- BUT this redefinition of “worlds” also connects to early 20th-century geography and politics, where ideas like Lebensraum linked environment to identity, a link later co-opted by Nazi ideology

---

(§13) the open, "Not even the lark sees the open"  — Heidegger
- Heidegger’s discussion of “the open” develops from [[Rilke\|Rilke]]’s Eighth Duino Elegy but reverses its meaning: where Rilke says the animal “sees the open with all its eyes,” Heidegger insists only man can truly see the open ... understood as aletheia, the UNCONCEALMENT of being
- FOR HEIDEGGER, Rilke’s “open” belongs to a biological or psychological view ... IT forgets being, leading to anthropomorphizing of animals and the animalization of man
- FOR HEIDEGGER the animal does not see “the open” because it cannot relate to being as such .... i.e., it lives only within its circle of excitability ... bound to stimuli ... unable to let what excites it “be” as a being
- hence, the animal’s environment differs from the human world INSOFAR AS it depends on external disinhibitors without perceiving either “inside” or “outside” ... excluded from the domain of the conflict between disconcealment and concealment
- so animal life is negative theology, mirrors but does not achieve the conscious openness of dasein ...
- moth to flame .. intense relation unknown to the moth
- but this (calling animal poor in world) .. risks projection of human ontology

> “Nevertheless, in Heidegger’s course the animal’s poverty in world is at times reversed into an incomparable wealth, and the thesis according to which the animal is lacking in world is called into question as an undue projection of the human world onto the animal.”

- Romans 8:19, yearning of creation, is used to reframe the animals poorness of world as a metaphysical DOING WITHOUT that contains a hidden openness / disruption at core ...
- this shortens human animal distance .. animals poverty in world becomes background through which essence of humanity is revealed ..

> "Perhaps it is not the case that being and the human world have been presupposed in order then to reach the animal by means of subtraction—that is, by a “destructive observation”; perhaps the contrary is also, and even more, true, that is, that the openness of the human world (insofar as it is also and primarily an openness to the essential conflict between disconcealment and concealment) can be achieved only by means of an operation enacted upon the not-open of the animal world. And the place of this operation—in which human openness in a world and animal openness toward its disinhibitor seem for a moment to meet—is boredom."

- ↑ the connection between captivation (animals fixed openness ... according to Agamben, Heidegger oscillates between saying that "on the one hand, captivation is a more spellbinding and intense openness than any kind of human knowledge; on the other, insofar as it is not capable of disconcealing its own disinhibitor, it is closed in a total opacity.)with profound boredom (human empty openness) ...
- rather than thinking of the animal as human minus something (or human as animal plus something), the human world only understood via proximity to the animal's not-open state ... boredom as site when human openness and animal captivation touch

---

(§14) profound boredom
- boredom as occupying sections 18-39 of Heidegger's being and time ... 
- boredom is central because it reveals how dasein is placed before beings in their totality ...
- stages culminating in profound boredom
	- (1) Leergelassenheit .. being left empty .. when we find ourselves abandoned amid things that remain present yet offer us nothing
	- (2) emptiness → powerless to act → Hingehaltenheit ... being held in suspense ... possibilities of dasein show themselves as withheld ... revealing originary ground for possibilities (originary possibilization)
- profound boredom discloses the condition for possibility ...
	- suspension of dasein is important because unlike the animal in Benommenheit (captivation), which cannot suspend its relation to disinhibitors, dasein can deactivate its practical ties and so experience the background from which possibilities arise ...   
	- profound boredom as a metaphysical operation?
- lichtung (clearing) of human world is not new realm beyond animal life but is born from the suspension of animal relation .. the open (aletheia) is founded on a originary non open (lethe) whose secret precedes unconcealment ...
- HUMAN AS ANIMAL THAT HAS LEARNED TO BECOME BORED ...
- profound boredom grounds and questions metaphysics ... beings and nothing interweave (this is unconcealedness)
- awakened FROM its own captivation (as in, awakened by virtue of its own captivation) ... "awakening of the living being to its own being-captivated, this anxious and resolute opening to a not open, is the human"

> "Perhaps the tick in the Rostock laboratory guards a mystery of the “simply living being,” which neither Uexküll nor Heidegger was prepared to confront."

---

(§15) world and earth
- (remember, for Heidegger, work accomplishes strife ... this is the relationship between the work and truth insofar as truth is UNCONCEALING (to do with strife))

> If in the work the world represents the open, then the earth names “that which essentially closes itself in itself."

> World and earth, openness and closedness—though opposed in an essential conflict—are, however, never separable.

> The ontological paradigm of truth as the conflict between concealedness and unconcealedness is, in Heidegger, immediately and originarily a political paradigm. It is because man essentially occurs in the openness to a closedness that something like a polis and a politics are possible

- 1929-30 course of Heidegger's, Agamben argues, essentially tries to group together closedness, earth, lethe, etc. into the ANIMAL ...
- so these issues (the originary political conflict between concealedness and unconcealedness) becomes an issue of the humanity vs. the animality of man ...

> But here everything becomes complicated. For if what is proper to humanities is to remain open to the closedness of the animal, if what the world brings into the open is precisely and only the earth as what closes itself in itself, then how must we understand Heidegger’s reproach of metaphysics, and of the sciences that depend on it, for their thinking man “beginning with his animalitas and not thinking in the direction of his humanitas”? **If humanity has been obtained only through a suspension of animality, and must thus keep itself open to the closedness of animality, in what sense does Heidegger’s attempt to grasp the “existing essence of man” escape the metaphysical primacy of animalitas?**

---

(§16) animalization

> Heidegger was perhaps the last philosopher to believe in good faith that the place of the polis (the polos {pole} where the conflict between concealedness and unconcealedness, between the animalitas and the humanitas of man, reigns) was still practicable, and that it was still possible for men, for a people—holding themselves in that risky place—to find their own proper historical destiny. He was, that is, the last to believe (at least up to a certain point, and not without doubts and contradictions) that the anthropological machine, which each time decides upon and recomposes the conflict between man and animal, between the open and the not-open, could still produce history and destiny for a people. It is likely that at a certain point he realized his error, and understood that a decision that responded to a historical mission of being was nowhere possible.

- ↑ but, by 34-35 Heidegger realizes the possibility of a great disruption has closed (disruption again in the same sense as disruption = animals being exposed in something undisconcealed) ... "post-history was beginning to knock on the doors of a concluded metaphysics"
- 

> We completely misunderstand the nature of the great totalitarian experiments of the twentieth century if we see them only as a carrying out of the nineteenth-century nation-states’ last great tasks: nationalism and imperialism. The stakes are now different and much higher, for it is a question of taking on as a task the very factical existence of peoples, that is, in the last analysis, their bare life. Seen in this light, the totalitarianisms of the twentieth century truly constitute the other face of the Hegelo-Kojevian idea of the end of history: man has now reached his historical telos and, for a humanity that has become animal again, there is nothing left but the depoliticization of human societies by means of the unconditioned unfolding of the oikonomia, or the taking on of biological life itself as the supreme political (or rather impolitical) task

- at this point we can realize, perhaps, a more complete conception of Kojeve's idea regarding the animal as human ... American as human v. Japanese etc. earlier ... 
	- INSOFAR AS the only task that remains (humanity's last historical task) is biological life (natural life and well being) ... I.E., THE ANIMALITY OF MAN

> The traditional historical potentialities—poetry, religion, philosophy—which from both the Hegelo-Kojevian and Heideggerian perspectives kept the historico-political destiny of peoples awake, have long since been transformed into cultural spectacles and private experiences, and have lost all historical efficacy.

- ↑ hence, "man" doing history becomes impossible → only task that remains is biological life ... I.E., THE ANIMALITY OF MAN
- is this still human? is the mandate of management of our animality still human? i.e., is it OUR decision (or something like that?) ↓

> **To be sure, such a humanity, from Heidegger’s perspective, no longer has the form of keeping itself open to the undisconcealed of the animal, but seeks rather to open and secure the not-open in every domain, and thus closes itself to its own openness, forgets its humanitas, and makes being its specific disinhibitor. The total humanization of the animal coincides with a total animalization of man**

(§17) anthropogenesis, western philosophy's anthropological machine
- (1) "anthropogenesis is what results from the caesura and articulation between human and animal. This caesura passes first of all within man."
- (2) ontology is not innocuous, it is where the realization (see "destituent potentiality and the critique of realization") of anthropogenesis, and ↓

> From the beginning, metaphysics is taken up in this strategy: it concerns precisely that *meta* that completes and preserves the overcoming of animal *physis* in the direction of human history. This overcoming is not an event that has been completed once and for all, but an occurrence that is always under way, that every time and in each individual decides between the human and the animal, between nature and history, between life and death.

- (3) being, world, and the open are "nothing but the interruption and capture of the living being’s relationship with its disinhibitor"
	- **open as nothing but grasping the animal not-open ... "man suspends his animality and, in this way, opens a 'free and empty' zone in which life is captured and abandoned in a zone of exception"** (sum of ↑)
- (4) world opens only by suspension and capture of animal life ... being is always already negative
- (5) "In our culture, the decisive political conflict, which governs every other conflict, is that between the animality and the humanity of man. That is to say, in its origin Western politics is also biopolitics"
	- western politics has ALWAYS been biopolitics. against Foucault's account
- (6) if anthropological machine → man's becoming historical ... so end of history (end of philosophy?) means machine is idling (?)
- so (for Heidegger) either (a) posthistorical man no longer preserves animality as undisclosable, seeks to govern it by means of technology, or (b) man appropriates his own concealedness (his animality), thinking of it as such, not as hidden or an object of mastery, but pure abandonment

(§18) between, "all the enigmas of the world seem slight to us compared to the tiny secret of sex" — Foucault
- [[Benjamin\|Benjamin]] imagines a "between" — suspension of anthropological machine

(§19) desœuvrement
- idleness
- mystery becomes inoperative
- just as in Benjamin, entrance into "new blessed life" ... in this case, one that is NEITHER HUMAN NOR ANIMAL ... or, the possibility of a human non-human component, via Titian paintings

> The enigma of the sexual relationship between the man and the woman, which was already at the center of the first painting, thus receives a new and more mature formulation. Sensual pleasure and love—as the half-bloomed tree bears witness—do not prefigure only death and sin. To be sure, in their fulfillment the lovers learn something of each other that they should not have known—they have lost their mystery—and yet have not become any less impenetrable. But in this mutual disenchantment from their secret, they enter, just as in Benjamin’s aphorism, a new and more blessed life, one that is neither animal nor human. It is not nature that is reached in their fulfillment, but rather (as symbolized by the animal that rears up the Tree of Life and of Knowledge) a higher stage beyond both nature and knowledge, beyond concealment and disconcealment. These lovers have initiated each other into their own lack of mystery as their most intimate secret; they mutually forgive each other and expose their vanitas. Bare or clothed, they are no longer either concealed or unconcealed—but rather, inapparent {*inapparenti*}. As is clear from both the posture of the two lovers and the flute taken from the lips, their condition is *otium*, it is workless {*senz’opera*}. If it is true, as Dundas writes, that in these paintings Titian has created “a realm in which to reflect on the relationship between body and spirit,” in the Vienna painting this relationship is, so to speak, neutralized. In their fulfillment, the lovers who have lost their mystery contemplate a human nature rendered perfectly inoperative—the inactivity {*inoperosità*} and desœuvrement of the human and of the animal as the supreme and unsavable figure of life.

(§20) outside of being
- Agamben returns to the animal-headed effigies reproduced by Bataille from the Gnostic Basilides
- divine elements return to origin → "great ignorance" → creatures exist naturally, desiring nothing beyond
- Agamben links effigies to ignorance, and to forgiveness ... suggesting that to ARTICULATE NON-KNOWLEDGE IS TO LET SOMETHING BE OUTSIDE OF BEING ↓
- this is in contrast with Heidegger's "letting be" ... Heidegger's is ontology grounded in human openness to being, but what would it mean to LET THE ANIMAL BE? since it exists outside of being altogether
- zone of nonknowledge ... allows to exists without metaphysical distinctions ...
	- the goal is to render the anthropological machine inoperative by dwelling in the in between
	- this is "life outside being"
	- just like Basilides blessed matter ... the righteous with animal heads are SAVED IN THEIR UNSAVABILITY
# Introduction: Three Registers of Destitution

The concept of "destitution" is a total critique against politics, it is a complete shattering of first principles. Questions arise as to how we can, or do, position ourselves within this fragmented terrain.

---

> “Despite their many tactical innovations, it is obvious that a strategic horizon capable of gathering the many fragmentary episodes of rage and dignity under a common truth is wanting”

- DESTITUTION as defining the rift between political life in 21st century and classical paradigms of revolt and revolution
	- as:
		- (1) political form of revolt  
		- (2) epochal or civilizational implosion of subjectivity  
		- (3) ethical task confronting those who must learn to inhabit this fragmented terrain

---

(§1) political form of revolt, refusal of politics
- looks to tear down (not necessarily positing something new) .... refusal of ordinary politics ... total critique

> the Argentine movement laid waste not merely to the legitimacy of the state and its police but equally to the illusory promises of its official opposition

> such messianic deposition of politicism is never a peaceful affair

---

(§2) epochal or civilizational implosion of subjectivity, an anarchic epoch
- shattering of archai, the binding representations or metaphysics that previously acted as Firsts ... the very “possibility of deriving political principles from principles of ontology” has entered into crisis ... 
- (Agamben locates this also in the desire to realize the proletariat)
- the search, among destituent theorists, for an outside starting points → led them to the concept of anthropological revolution ...

---

(§3)

> In what sense can the no of political refusal be said to envelop a moment of ethical positivity?

- can we collectively constitute ourselves AS destituent?
- (my note: all of this seems like a political revolutionary way of asking the question continental philosophy has been asking since Hegel ... how can we get outside the dialectic? Hegel's dialecticism is so radical. we are dialectical. us ourselves our life. Agamben locates this. but how can we get outside this?)
# "Destituent Potentiality and the Critique of Realization"

**[[Agamben\|Agamben]] argues that it is destitute potentiality, not mere strategies of destitution, that is important. Destituent potentiality can never be something that must be realized, it is outside of realization, the metaphysical paradigm between "possible and real," essence and existence, potentiality and not. These are the two faces of the ontological machine of the west, which functions by articulating the two sides together (in concordance of discordance).** 

---

(9)
- not merely the strategy of destitution
- but the concept of DESTITUTE POTENTIALITY itself
- Agamben: destitute potentiality → the strategy of destitution
- understanding DP requires freedom from REALIZATION ... the metaphysical paradigm of REALIZATION
- realization = "the idea that political action consists in realizing, in facts or deeds, a doctrine, a philosophy, an ideal, a plan, or whatever else one wants to call this sort of obscure presupposition to every political praxis"
- → “a necessity to translate into reality something possible that is clearly supposed not to be real or not yet real”
- → this is a METAPHYSICAL PARADIGM insofar as it is the separation between the possible and the real, which western metaphysics is based on ....

---

(10)
- R in politics is usually attributed to [[Marx\|Marx]]: he says “philosophy cannot be realized without the abolition of the proletariat; the proletariat cannot be abolished without the realization of philosophy”
	- the proletariat cannot be abolished without the REALIZATION (Marx's critique of Hegel's "philosophy of right")
- → Agamben questions what this really means, it lacks clarity ... what does realization really mean? to realize itself?

---

- related notions of "abolish" ... end? a telos of ends and completion
	- Paul's biblicism interpretation of canonical law: his target is the idea that justice is the REALIZATION of law, i.e., actions that make commandments REAL
	- his goal is not to destroy, but to MAKE INOPERATIVE; to not put into act (insofar as to abolish or destroy is also to realize)
	- non-realizability in fact (messianism)
- (throughout, remember that Agamben is thinking about POTENTIALITY, NOT POWER ... i.e., not a Nietzschean positive will)

---

- ↑ Hegel opposite this whole picture of Paul's biblicism
	- Hegel maintains realization, even in completion
- in this, reality is just the process of realization, the becoming real of a possibility
- Agamben is to free us
- he says the politics of Plato and Benjamin are removed from realization (the "possible is already real" and Marxism never works if we think of it as some possibility always coming)

---

(15-17)
- "possible and real," essence and existence, potentiality and not, are two faces of the ONTOLOGICAL MACHINE of the west
	- this machine functions by articulating the two sides together (in concordance of discordance) ... this is the motor

> Insofar as we insist on seeking a passage, a transit, or a transition from the possible to the real, the ontological argument still rests firmly at the very heart of politics.

- **so a destituent potentiality can never be something that must be realized**
# *The Coming Community*

**[[Agamben\|Agamben]]'s explanation of “whatever being,” the centerpiece of his ontological project. Whatever being is a response to the dominant thought that goodness is difference — that identity comes through difference — and that evil is indifference. Agamben’s ontology is, in this sense, beyond good and evil — is anti-Hegelian. But his anti-Hegelianism is different than that of e.g., Nietzsche’s insofar as he resists a return to a positive force or will as grounding ontology. Instead, Agamben shows that something inauthentic, improper, indifferent, or other than itself, is already ontologically important. So, “whatever being” — or the possibility of non-being — is Agamben’s grounding of ontology that is both anti-Hegelian and non-positive. He explains "whatever being" as it relates to theological traditions, philosophy of language, love, and more.**

---

(§1) whatever

> The coming being is whatever being. In the Scholastic enumeration of  transcendentals (*quodlibet ens est unum, verum, bonum seu perfectum* — whatever entity is one, true, good, or perfect), the term that, remaining unthought in each, conditions the meaning of all the others is the adjective "whatever" (*quodlibet*). The common translation of this term as "whatever" in the sense of "it does not matter which, indifferently" is certainly correct, but in its form the Latin says exactly the opposite: *Quodlibet ens* is not "being, it does not matter which," but rather "being such that it always matters." The Latin always already contains, that is, a reference to the will (*libet*). Whatever being has an original relation to desire.

- the "whatever" is neither a universal or particular ... it is only in its being such as it is ... it is a singularity insofar as it is a whatever singularity .. not this or that class
- LOVE is the same ^ ... not just particulars of the loved nor an "insipid generality" ... rather, the loved with ALL OF ITS PREDICATES, its being such as it is ..

> Whatever singularity (the Lovable) is never the intelligence of some thing, of this or that quality or essence, but only the intelligence of an intelligibility

---

(§2) from limbo
- where do whatever singularities come from?
	- Agamben turns to Aquinas on limbo (non baptized babies dead) ... they do not know of supernatural, else they would unjustly feel pain from lack ... their bodies are impassible with respect to divine justice, but natural otherwise ..

> The greatest punishment-the lack of the vision of God-thus turns into a natural joy: Irremediably lost, they persist without pain in divine abandon. God has not forgotten them, but rather they have always already forgotten God; and in the face of their forgetfulness, God's forgetting is impotent

> This nature of limbo is the secret of Robert Walser's world: His creatures are irreparably astray, but in a region that is beyond perdition and salvation: Their nullity, of which they are so proud, is principally a neutrality with respect to salvation

- compare with §20 of *the open*: the righteous with animal heads are SAVED IN THEIR UNSAVABILITY

---

(§3) example

> The fortune of set theory in modern logic is born of the fact that the definition of the set is simply the definition of linguistic meaning

- ↑ and this is why Russell's paradox can't just be "solved" by changing the rules of set theory ... the whole thing is about predication itself
	- the paradoxes DEFINE THE PLACE OF LINGUISTIC BEING ... which is "a class that both belongs and does not belong to itself, and the class of all classes that do not belong to themselves is language” ... set of all sets that do not contain themselves
- the EXAMPLE escapes universal-particular antinomy ... the example is a singular object that presents itself as such, that shows its singularity .... where examples are (exemplary being) linguistic .. linguistic being = being-called
	- (**purely linguistic being is constituted by ONLY being-called ... example is ONLY being-called**)
- pure singularities communicate only in the empty space of the example (since communication requires no shared property or identity, it must communicate in a medium that requires no shared property or identity, i.e., the example) ... “they are expropriated of all identity, so as to appropriate belonging itself, the sign c. tricksters or fakes, assistants or 'toons, they are the exemplars of the coming community"

---

(§4) taking place

> the meaning of ethics becomes clear only when one understands that the good is not, and cannot be, a good thing or possibility beside or above every bad thing or possibility, that the authentic and the true are not real predicates of an object perfectly analogous (even if opposed) to the false and the inauthentic. Ethics begins only when the good is revealed to consist in nothing other than a grasping of evil and when the authentic and the proper have no other content than the inauthentic and the improper

> the perfect has appropriated all the possibilities of evil and impropriety and therefore cannot commit evil

- God as the taking place of everything ... the TAKING-PLACE ... not a supreme entity above all things

---

(§5) principium individuationis
- how can we think of singularity? not particular or universal ...
	- for Aquinas, matter-form
	- for Duns Scotus, matter is not source of individuation ... individuation is IN ADDITION, haecceitas (thisness) ...
	- humanity + haecceity = "this human" ...  
	- but Agamben thinks this makes a mistake insofar as if thinks of INDIFFERENCE as foundation of individuation ... 
	- that is, for Agamben, the singularity of a being is not simply the result of taking a neutral substrate and adding haecceity to it ...
	- quodlibetity (a mode of being where singularity matters as such, not through qualities, properties, or forms) is NOT indifference (lack of distinctions) ...  
- what is the real relation?
	- Agamben thinks Spinoza is valuable here: inessential commonality, a solidarity that does not concern an essence ...
	- so, "taking-place, the communication of singularities in the attribute of extension, does not unite them in essence, but scatters them in existence."

> Whatever is the thing with all its properties, none of which, however, constitutes difference. In-difference with respect to properties is what individuates and disseminates singularities, makes them lovable (quodlibetable)

> Common and proper, genus and individual are only the two slopes dropping down from either side of the watershed of whatever

> The being that is engendered on this line is whatever being, and the .manner in which it passes from the common to the proper and from the proper to the common is called usage-or rather, ethos

(§6)
- in Talmud, two places are reserved for each person: Eden and Gehenna ... double punishment for the unjust ...

“But there is also another interpretation of Badaliya. According to Massignon, in fact, substituting oneself for another does not mean compensating for what the other lacks, nor correcting his or her errors, but exiling oneself to the other as he or she is in order to offer Christ hospitality in the other's own soul, in the other's own taking-place. This substitution no longer knows a place of its own, but the taking-place of every single being is always already common - an empty space offered to the one, irrevocable hospitality.” (Agamben, 1993, p. 31)

“In this sense, ease names perfectly that "free use of the proper" that, according to an expression of Friedrich Holderlins, is "the most difficult task." "Mout mi semblatz de bel aizin." This is the greeting that, in jaufre Rudel's song, the lovers exchange when they meet.” (Agamben, 1993, p. 32)

(Agamben, 1993, p. 32) ? ^

“This is not, in' terms of the division that dominates Western ontology, either an essence or an existence, but a manner of rising forth; not a being that is in this or that mode, but a being that is its mode of being, and thus, while remaining singular and not indifferent, is multiple and valid for all.” (Agamben, 1993, p. 35)

“continually engendered from its own manner.” (Agamben, 1993, p. 35)

(Agamben, 1993, p. 35) GA trying to show a singularit that is not presuppositional ... but not accidental .. neither accidental nor necessary ..  
trying for anti-Hegelianism

“That manner is ethical that does not befall us and does not found us but engenders us. And this being engendered from one's own manner is the only happiness really possible for humans.” (Agamben, 1993, p. 36)

“But a manner of rising forth is also the place of whatever singularity, its principium individuationis. For the being that is its own manner this is not, in effect, so much a property that determines and identifies it as an essence, but rather an irnproperty; what makes it exemplary, however, .is that this improperty is assumed and· appropriated as its unique being. The example is only the being of that of which it is the example; but this being does not belong to it, it is perfectly common. The improperty, which we expose as our proper being, manner, which we use, engenders us. It is our second, happier, nature.” (Agamben, 1993, p. 36)

“It is, in every being that exists, the possibility of not-being that silently calls for our help (or, if you wish, the devil is nothing other than divine impotence or the power of not-being in God). Evil is only our inadequate reac/tion when faced with this demonic element” (Agamben, 1993, p. 38)

“Creation-or existence-is not the victorious struggle of a power to be against a power to not-be; it is rather the impotence of God with respect to his own impotence, his allowing-being able to not not-be-a contingency to be. Or rather: It is the birth in God of love” (Agamben, 1993, p. 39) i.e., existence is not an immanent difference with non-existence ... what is being said INSTEAD here? i can GUESS, but this seems odd

“Their demon is not a tempter, but a being infinitely susceptible to being tempted.” (Agamben, 1993, p. 39)

(Agamben, 1993, p. 44) whatever being is tied to the capacity of not-being (genuine potentiality is potentiality to not be, aristotle)  
...  
object of potentiality is a determinate act ,... but object fo not be has potentiality itself as object ..

“Bartleby, a scribe who does not simply cease writing but "prefers not to," is the extreme image of this angel that writes nothing but its potentiality to not-write.” (Agamben, 1993, p. 44) symbol of pure potentiality as impotence

“The logical difficulty that these questions run up against is that, if the sensible world was ordered to fit the dignity and the habitation of imperfect humans, then what sense can that world have when those humans arrive at their supernatural destination? How can nature survive the accomplishment of its final cause?” (Agamben, 1993, p. 46)

“Irreparable means that these things are consigned without remedy to their being-thus, that they are precisely and only their thus (nothing is more foreign to Walser than the pretense of being other than what one is); but irreparable also means that for them there is literally no shelter possible, that in their being-thus they are absolutely exposed, absolutely abandoned.” (Agamben, 1993, p. 46)

(Agamben, 1993, p. 47) GA uses Walter to say that after last judgment,the world persists exactly as it is in a state of irreparable being-thus. ... fulfillment without lament (Holderlin)

(Agamben, 1993, p. 50) ethics ONLY exists because there is NOT a "human essence" ... a purpose .. or else ther ewould just be tasks to be done (is this true of immanent dialecticism too) ..  
but humans are something and have to be something .. but this is not an esence nor a "thing" ,,, "It is the simple fact  of one's own existence as possibility or potentiality. But precisely because of  this things become complicated; precisely because of this ethics becomes  effective."

“This is all that is meant by the old theological doctrine of original sin. Morality, on the other hand, refers this doctrine to a blameworthy act humans have committed and, in this way, shackles their potentiality, turning it back toward the past. The recognition of evil is older and more original than any blameworthy act, and it rests solely on the fact that, being and having to be only its possibility or potentiality, humankind fails itself in a certain sense and has to appropriate this failing-it has to exist as potentiality.” (Agamben, 1993, p. 51)

“The only evil consists instead in the decision to remain in a deficit of existence, to appropriate the power to not-be as a substance and a foundation beyond existence; or rather (and this is the destiny of morality), to regard potentiality itself, which is the most proper mode of human existence. as a fault that must always be repressed.” (Agamben, 1993, p. 51)

(Agamben, 1993, p. 51) so ...  if what humans “are” is their own potentiality (which can also not-be) .... then humans lack a stable foundation ... what wWhat humans “are” is precisely this potentiality-to-be/not-be.  
  
SO THEREFORE humans are groundlessly exposed, fundamentally lacking any foundation  
(this is Caevll's project as I read it, but certainly they get there differently .. Cavell certainly does not geberate a positive force as does Nietzche / Deleuze .. but would Cavell fight against what GA is doing here? or does the language philospher mean something DIFFERENT by "positive: .. remember Rorty (in consequences of pragmatism intro ... ) says that continental philsophers post linguistic turn are lock step w the pragmatist (contra positivism) .. but the language philosopher offers SOME view that is not merely negative??) ,

(Agamben, 1993, p. 57) human body was historically bound to theological foundations (“image and likeness”) that made its form ineffable and uncommunicable ..  
capitalist commodification emancipates the body from this theological anchoring BUT preserves resemblance without an archetype (an IDEA)  
this produces a new bodily ontology: the “whatever” body, defined by fungibility + resemblance without origin (Idea),,,  
contemporary technocapitalism manipulates and spectacularizes the image of the body while leaving the actual body untransformed, creating a split.  
and if humanity does not reunite body and image, commodification remains a spectacle; but if it does, it can reclaim the whatever body as the site of a new THEREFORE humanity must seize from capitalist spectacle the emergent whatever body by reconnecting body and image beyond commodification.
