# moving from representation to representationalism and anti-representationalism

see [[Foucault\|Foucault]]'s *The Order of Things* for history of philosophy account of representation ([[Descartes\|Descartes]], [[Kant\|Kant]])

in general
[[Rorty\|Rorty]] as global anti-R
[[Misak\|Misak]] (P) contra Rorty, pro [[Price\|Price]] (complicated insofar as Price thinks of himself as Rortyan)
Price, after [[Blackburn\|Blackburn]]'s local-E, synthesizes two kinds of E (original German E, e.g., [[Herder\|Herder]], and 2nd wave meta-ethical E, e.g., Blackburn) and then P and E

Rorty: it's not just representation, it's R
a semantic ideology that meaning should be understood primarily or only in terms of their representational relations, what they (purport to) represent —
it was important at its time (Descartes, Kant) but must be wholly abandoned (we must not think of ourselves as mirrors of nature, see PMN) —
instead, P
all of this is "in" all of post-Kantian philosophy, so, under P, philosophy will be something else
(in this, Rorty gets "left out" of analytic philosophy)

larger movements at play: EW and LW
EW → logical tradition ([[Carnap\|Carnap]], [[Quine\|Quine]], [[Kripke\|Kripke]], etc.)
LW → anthropological tradition (classical American P, early [[Heidegger\|Heidegger]])
(in fact, Misak will say that LW is a Cambridge P. Rorty says early Heidegger is too; Misak and Heideggerians are appalled by this, except [[Dreyfus\|Dreyfus]])

but some distinctions have to be made:
[[Sellars\|Sellars]] and D
D as the "tendency to assimilate all discourse to describing." -> "nothing-but-isms," i.e., ABC is "nothing but" XYZ, e.g., behaviorism
(this is clearly a form of R, but what's the distinction? R is wider than D; all D is R, but not all R is D, e.g., proper names)

there is "fact-stating discourse"
prioritizing this discourse is *ideological* to Rorty

contra D is E
in 20th century, meta-ethical E of [[Ayer\|Ayer]] and [[Stevenson\|Stevenson]]
Blackburn extends beyond the meta-ethical via [[Hume\|Hume]].
Sellars and Blackburn are *local* anti-R
Rorty is *global* anti-R
→ Sellars and Blackburn are happy to use D and R locutions to think about *some* discursive practices, e.g., "frog is on the log"
Rorty (and Price and original German E) says *even this* we shouldn't think of as D or R
instead, it's a *mode of coping*

regarding that R is wider than D; all D is R, but not all R is D
→ declarativism
declarative sentences as fact-stating, OED
contra this, see [[Geach\|Geach]]'s essay "Ascriptivism"
"macarize" ... for Geach, there is an "embedding test"
if I can say "if x is happy, then ..."
then I have done some D, fact-stating (this is cheap global-R)
the anti-R has to explain this (so Geach provides a criterion of adequacy)

Price: any local E relies on a BIFURCATION THESIS
a principled distinction between vocabularies — between discourse that *is* D or R, and discourse that is declarative, i.e., embeddable but not D or R
(Price argues this via subject and object naturalism)
...
Price, via W, wants us to be subject naturalists (insofar as object naturalism suffers from [[Frank Jackson\|Frank Jackson]]'s "location problems," and [[D.M. Armstrong\|D.M. Armstrong]]'s "truth-makers")

[[Brandom\|Brandom]] denies this. He is local anti-R

# Rorty's critique of Enlightenment R, and (so) of analytic philosophy

in PMN, [[Rorty\|Rorty]]'s core argument is a Manichean struggle in post-[[Kant\|Kant]]ian philosophy
(1) neo-Kantianism (ending in [[C.I. Lewis\|C.I. Lewis]] and [[Carnap\|Carnap]])
aiming to posit a general theory of knowledge, so understanding common structure of understanding, philosophy as the "QUEEN OF THE SCIENCES"
(2) [[Hegel\|Hegel]] (according to Rorty) takes this view and socializes / historicizes it
(Marx naturalizes it, making possible the bringing of philosophy back down to earth. study of practices, continuous with non-discursive animals) (this possibility is taken up by original American pragmatists, e.g., [[Peirce\|Peirce]])
-> but it was not meant to be, cause [[Russell\|Russell]] and [[Husserl\|Husserl]] invent different things for philosophy to  be apodictic about (& a priori)

Rorty says: analytic philosophy is just 20th century neo-Kantianism
but, Rorty says [[Quine\|Quine]] and [[Sellars\|Sellars]] are P critics of analytic philosophy and should go alongside the original American pragmatists (so, the 20th century is just an unfortunate detour, despite development of technical tools of knowledge)

implicit in the claim that the traditions of Russell and Husserl are not that different (they are just neo-Kantian)
